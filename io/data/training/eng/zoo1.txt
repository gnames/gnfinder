                Abstract
                We relimit and revise the family Selenopidae to include four new genera and 27 new species from Australia and the Oriental Region. The family is redefined, as are the genera Anyphops Benoit, Garcorops Corronca, Hovops Benoit, Selenops Latreille, and Siamspinops Dankittipakul & Corronca, to accommodate the new genera and to correct previous inconsistencies in the diagnoses and definitions of the aforementioned genera. The species of Selenops that occur throughout India and China are also reviewed. Three species occur in China: Selenops bursarius Karsch 1879, also known from Japan, Korea and Taiwan, Selenops ollarius Zhu, Sha, & Chen 1990, and Selenops radiatus Latreille 1819, the type of the genus and most widespread selenopid. Selenops cordatus Zhu, Sha & Chen syn. n. is recognized as a junior synonym of Selenops radiatus. Amamanganops gen. n. is monotypic, with Amamanganops baginawa sp. n. (♀; from the Philippines). Godumops gen. n. is monotypic, with Godumops caritus sp. n. (♂; from Papua New Guinea). Karaops gen. n. occurs throughout Australia and includes 24 species. A new combination is proposed for Karaops australiensis (L. Koch 1875) comb. n. (ex. Selenops), and the new species: Karaops gangarie sp. n. (♀, ♂), Karaops monteithi sp. n. (♀), Karaops alanlongbottomi sp. n. (♂), Karaops keithlongbottomi sp. n. (♂), Karaops larryoo sp. n. (♂), Karaops jarrit sp. n. (♂,♀), Karaops marrayagong sp. n. (♀), Karaops raveni sp. n. (♂,♀), Karaops badgeradda sp. n. (♀), Karaops burbidgei sp. n. (♂,♀), Karaops karrawarla sp. n. (♂,♀), Karaops julianneae sp. n. (♀), Karaops martamarta sp. n. (♀), Karaops manaayn sp. n. (♀, ♂), Karaops vadlaadambara sp. n. (♀, ♂), Karaops pilkingtoni sp. n. (♀, ♂), Karaops deserticola sp. n. (♀), Karaops ngarutjaranya sp. n. (♂,♀), Karaops francesae sp. n. (♂,♀), Karaops toolbrunup sp. n. (♀, ♂), the type species Karaops ellenae sp. n. (♂,♀), Karaops jenniferae sp. n. (♀), and Karaops dawara sp. n. (♀).The genus Makdiops gen. n. contains five species from India and Nepal. A new combination is proposed for Makdiops agumbensis (Tikader 1969), comb. n., Makdiops montigenus (Simon 1889), comb. n., Makdiops nilgirensis (Reimoser 1934) comb. n.,(ex. Selenops). Also, there are two new species the type of the genus Makdiops mahishasura sp. n. (♀; from India), and Makdiops shiva sp. n. (♀). The genus Pakawops gen. n. is monotypic. A new combination is proposed for Pakawops formosanus (Kayashima 1943) comb. n. (ex. Selenops), known only from Taiwan. A new combination is proposed for Siamspinops aculeatus (Simon)comb. n. (ex. Selenops). The distribution and diversity of the studied selenopid fauna is discussed. Finally, keys are provided to all of the selenopid genera and to the species of Karaops gen. n.and Makdiops gen. n.

            Introduction
            Spiders of the family Selenopidae are distributed in the tropical and subtropical regions worldwide. Also known as wall crab spiders or flatties, they are exceptional in that both their running and striking speeds place them amongst the world’s fastest animals (Crews et al. 2008; Crews unpubl. data), and they are also extremely flattened dorsoventrally. The family currently comprises around 200 species in five genera (Corronca 1998; Platnick 2010): Anyphops Benoit 1968, Garcorops Corronca 2003, Hovops Benoit 1968, Siamspinops Dankittipakul & Corronca 2009, and Selenops Latreille 1819, the first three being distributed in Africa and Madagascar, Siamspinops in Southeast Asia, and Selenops as currently defined, is distributed worldwide.
            Revisionary and descriptive work for Anyphops, Hovops and Garcorops has been achieved by Lawrence (1940), Benoit (1968), and, more recently, by (Corronca (1996, 2000, 2003, 2005). The genus Selenops has been revised primarily by region, with the African species examined by (Lawrence (1940, 1942), Benoit (1968), and (Corronca (2001, 2002), and the South American species revised by (Corronca (1996, 1998). In the West Indies and Central America, the last major revisionary work was conducted by Muma (1953), while (Alayón-García (1992, 2001, 2003, 2005) has revised the species in Cuba and completed other regional descriptions, while only a few species have been described from México (Valdez-Mondragón 2007, 2010) since Muma’s work (1953). Recently, Crews (in press) has undertaken a revision of the species of Selenops from North America, Central America and the West Indies, excluding Cuban endemics, resulting in 66 species for this region.
            While it has long been known that species of Selenopidae occur in Asia and Australia (e.g., Karsch 1879; L. Koch 1875; Simon 1889a, 1901), the only recent work comes from Dankittipakul and Corronca (2009), in which a new genus, Siamspinops, is described, as well as several species from Southeast Asia. A handful of species, all placed in the genus Selenops, have also been described from various locations in Asia including India, China, Japan and Taiwan (Karsch 1879; Simon 1889b, 1901; Gravely 1931; Reimoser 1934; Kayashima 1943a, b; Tikader 1969; Patel and Patel 1973; Zhu et al. 1990), however, based on the dearth of specimens in museums, it is clear that more collecting from this region is needed.
            Although the Australian fauna is restricted to a single species, Selenops australiensis L. Koch from northeastern Queensland (L. Koch 1875), a wide variety of new species have been recently detected amongst museum collections. These taxa represent a previously unreported spider radiation from mainland Australia.
            The purpose of this paper is twofold. First, we focus on the genera of the family Selenopidae. This includes providing more solid definitions of each genus, describing five new genera, and providing a key to the genera of the family Selenopidae. Second, we provide a revision of the species of Selenopidae from Australasia, describing 27 new species. A key to the Australian species of Karaops gen. n.and a key to the new Asian genus Makdiops gen. n. are also provided.
        
        
            Materials and methods
            Taxa were described and illustrated primarily from specimens stored in 75% ethyl alcohol. In some cases, specimens were not available for direct examination, and we based our conclusions on published descriptions. Female copulatory organs were dissected and cleared using pancreatin (Álvarez-Padilla and Hormiga 2008). Digital images were prepared using a Leica DFC 500 attached to a LEICA MZ16A microscope and the software program AutoMontage Pro Version 5.02 (p) by Syncroscopy. Illustrations were prepared directly from the specimen or from digital images. The left palpus was illustrated, or if unavailable, a photograph of the right palpus was reversed. Positions on the face of the left bulb oriented in a standard ‘upright’ position are denoted by referring to a clock dial. Measurements were made using an ocular micrometer or from digital images, and are given in millimeters. Leg spination patterns follow that of Platnick and Shadab (1975). When a ventral leg spination pattern is given for the tibiae and metatarsi, such as 4–3, it means there are 4 pairs of ventral spines on the tibiae and 3 pairs of ventral spines on the metatarsi. Somatic characters are as defined in Ubick et al. (2005), and genitalic characters for selenopids follow that of (Corronca (1998, 2002, 2003, 2005), except for the posterodorsal fold which Corronca called the uterus externus (see Crews, in press).

                    Definition.
                    Benoit (1968) clearly defined the family Selenopidae. Here, we revise this definition to accommodate new species and new genera within the family. All members of the Selenopidae are extremely dorsoventrally flattened, have two tarsal claws and laterigrade legs. They are ecribellate, entelegynes, with eight eyes in two rows; with six in the first row and two in the second row (see also Jocqué and Dippenaar-Schoeman 2006).
                
                
                    Description.
                    Selenopidae are a variety of colors including various shades of grey, brown, yellow, and orange, with darker markings on the cephalothorax and spots or mottling on the abdomen, and annulations on the legs of most species. Chelicerae robust with 2 to 4 cheliceral teeth on each margin. Clypeus is low and chilum absent. Most genera have a longitudinal fovea with lateral radiations, 3 on each side. Labium wider than long, or as long as wide. Endites with dense terminal scopulae. Sternum oval to round with a posterior indentation; sternum extending between coxae IV. Six spinnerets; colulus absent. The legs are long and robust, with the tibiae and metatarsi of legs I and II with paired spines; these spines are the primary character that we use to separate genera. Tarsal scopulae present or absent in both males and females. Tarsal claws variable, prolateral claw is toothed and retrolateral claw is smooth in several species, but in several instances they are both toothed, with prolateral claw having more teeth than the retrolateral claw, or both claws can be smooth. Like in most spider groups, species of selenopids are differentiated by the copulatory organs, thus, the copulatory organs are variable. In many species the epigynum has a median septum and lateral lobes, however there are exceptions. Spermathecae highly sclerotized and occur in various shapes and sizes, from simple to complex (Figs 2–3). Male palps with RTA that is 2–3 branched in many species, with dorsal and ventral branches, or dorsal, median, and ventral branches (Figs 5–6, 83–84); conductor present, often sclerotized (Figs 5–6, 83–84).
                
                
                    Distribution.
                    The Selenopidae occur worldwide and are primarily tropical and subtropical, though several species are found in deserts, and can be found from sea level to over 2500 meters.

                        Diagnosis.
                        All members of this genus can be distinguished from other genera by the ventral spination on the tibiae and metatarsi of legs I and II, where there are 3 pairs of spines on the tibiae, and 2 pairs of spines on the metatarsi.
                    
                    
                        Remarks.
                        Despite the amount of recent work that has been done on the family, there is still some difficulty in determining boundaries of genera, in particular with the genus Selenops. (Corronca (1998, 2002) has provided diagnoses of the genera of Selenopidae, but there are many variations, and several species considered in the present study do not quite fit into the genus Selenops as currently defined. Walckenaer (1837) first recognized three groups based on characteristics of the chelicerae, labium and leg lengths. These characters were not substantiated by Simon (1880) who attempted to divide the family into Old and New World species based on eye size. In the New World, F. O. Pickard-Cambridge (1900) first distinguished species using eye size and position along with genitalic characters. (Petrunkevitch (1925, 1930) divided these species into groups and described new species based on leg proportions. In 1953, Muma established six species groups for species from North and Central America and the Caribbean based on leg lengths, eye size and position, and genitalic characters. Current authors (Alayón-García 1992, 2001, 2003, 2005; Valdez-Mondragon 2007, 2010) still use these characters and groupings despite variation and species that do not fit into any group (Crews in press).
                        Additionally, molecular phylogenetic work (Crews and Gillespie 2010) and morphological data indicate that the monophyly of the genus Selenops is somewhat questionable. In the molecular phylogenies, Selenops is either para- or polyphyletic, though these results lack significant support in all trees. The para- and polyphyly occurs between the Old and New World selenopids. That is, the New World selenopids are monophyletic, and the Old World selenopids are not. Benoit (1968, p. 118) noted that American Selenops are very different from the African ones, and that they have nothing at the generic level in common with species from the Old World. He suggested that they should be the object of a new classification. Unfortunately, he did not elaborate further. We examined multiple species of New and Old World Selenops, but we have no better conclusion than Benoit (1968). We are unable to find any morphological characters that consistently differentiate Old and New World Selenops, and do not have enough molecular data from Old World species, and thus the genus is retained for both groups at this time.
                    
                    
                        Description.
                        Total length 4–20. Cephalothorax: Carapace with some marks, wider than long; long, narrow fovea with 6 radiating lines. Setae either plumose or stiff, sometimes both types occur on same specimen; clypeus low. Eyes: 6 eyes in anterior row, either in a straight line or slightly recurved; PME larger than AME in most specimens, but in some specimens equal or, rarely, smaller; eye size occasionally differs between sexes of same species; Chelicerae slightly geniculate, robust, with 3 prolateral and 2 retrolateral teeth. Legs: Leg II longer than leg IV in most species, however, this is not always the case. Leg lengths are highly variable in this genus, and do not seem to be a good indicator of phylogeny or classification; tibia and metatarsai with 3 and 2 ventral spines, respectively. Tarsal, and in some species, metatarsal scopulae present, especially in females. Female copulatory organs: Epigynum usually with lateral lobes, occasionally with epigynal pockets; some species have a posterodorsal fold (Crews, in press), which is an extension of the external copulatory organs that folds in and may cover spermathecae or internal ducts. Male copulatory organs: Tibia typically with 2, and in some species 3 apophyses, with dorsal apophysis longer than ventral one in most species; median apophysis is one or two branched, and can be translucent, or with one or both branches sclerotized.
                    
                    
                        Distribution.
                        Selenops occurs in the New World from southern North America, throughout Central America, to southern South America, including islands in the Caribbean Sea. In the Old World, Selenops occurs throughout Africa, the Mediterranean, Middle East, and Asia including Japan and Taiwan.

Revisionary work of the African Selenops species was done first by Lawrence (1940), followed by Benoit (1968), and Corronca (2002). Corronca (2001) has also described new species from the African region. Selenops radiatus, the type of the genus, is the most widespread species, occurring from northern Africa, throughout the Middle East and Mediterranean and into India and China. In the New World, Muma (1953) revised the North American, Central American and Caribbean Selenopidae. Corronca (1998) revised South American representatives. Alayón-García (2005) has revised the Cuban species and reviewed and described species from other Caribbean islands such as Jamaica (Alayón-García 2003), the Dominican Republic (Alayón-García 1992), and Curaçao (Alayón-García 2001). (Valdez-Mondragón (2007, 2010) has also described a handful of species from México. The most recent revision of the North and Central American and Caribbean species was done by Crews (in press). Below we include a special section reviewing the Selenops species found in China, as the literature is difficult to obtain.
                        
                            Selenops from China
                            The Chinese species have been reviewed by Zhu et al. (1990). Currently, there are only three species described from this vast region, one of which is widespread throughout eastern Asia, including China, Japan, Korea and Taiwan, and one has the largest range of any member of the genus. Here we review the species, synonymize one species, and provide collecting localities, information on the types and some natural history data.

                            Distribution.
                            This species has been found in China, Japan, Korea and Taiwan. In China, the species has been found in Sichuan (Chengdu, Xiushan), Henan (Xinyang), Jiangsu (Suzhou), and Zhejiang (Zhu et al. 1990).
                        
                        
                            Remarks.
                            In molecular phylogenetic analyses (Crews and Gillespie 2010), Selenops bursarius does not group with other Selenops species, but is instead always allied with Karaops gen. n. from Australia, though this relationship is not well supported. Selenops bursarius shares the 3–2 tibial-metatarsal ventral spination with Old and New World Selenops species, however the male palps are unique among selenopids. The RTA is very elaborate and consists of three apophyses; large dorsal and medial apophyses and a smaller ventral apophysis. The embolus resembles that of some Karaops gen. n.species in its shape and origin. The MA is bulbous, two-branched and highly sclerotized, a unique feature. Finally, the conductor is somewhat T-shaped, a characteristic found in several selenopid genera. We have chosen to retain this species in Selenops at the present time, though clearly it retains unique features and may indeed represent an undescribed lineage.
                        
                        
                            Natural history.
                            In China, it has been found on cedar (Cryptomeria japonica), where it hides under the bark during the day and comes out at night (Zhu et al. 1990).

                            Known only from Sichuan Province in China (Map 1); however, it is widespread from Africa, throughout the Mediterranean, India, and other parts of Asia. Thus, it is likely found elsewhere in China.
                        
                        
                            Remarks.
                            It is clear from the drawings provided by Zhu et al. (1990) that Selenops cordatus is a junior synonym of Selenops radiatus. This extends the range of Selenops radiatus even further east (Map 1), making it the most widespread member of the Selenopidae, the phylogeography of which would no doubt be interesting to study.

                        Etymology.
                        Amamanganops gen. n.comes from a combination of words and honors the indigenous peoples from the region of the type locality of this selenopid. Hanunuo Mangyan: Amamangan = spider; Greek: ops = face, eye. We retain the traditional ending of selenopid genera of ops, which originally referred to the eye arrangement. The gender is masculine.
                    
                    
                        Diagnosis.
                        Amamanganops gen. n. can be separated from all other genera by genitalic characters. The epigynum is the simplest known for all Selenopidae. It is not divided into lateral lobes, has a sinuous posterior margin, and has extremely simple and small internal ducts (Figs 1A–B). Males unknown.
                    
                    
                        Description.
                        Total length 6.90. Cephalothorax: Carapace with some dusky markings, wider than long. Fovea short, broad, and shallow. Setae variable, simple, with both long and thin and short and thick hairs present. AER straight, PER slightly recurved. PME equal to AME. Chelicerae slightly geniculate, robust, 3 prolateral and 2 retrolateral teeth. Legs: Leg II longer than leg IV, leg III longest. Right leg I has 4 paired spines on tibia and 3 on metatarsus; left leg is missing. Leg II has 5 paired spines on tibia and 3 on metatarsus. Tarsal scopulae absent. Female copulatory organs: Epigynum without lateral lobes, with a sinuate posterior margin, and epigynal pockets. Spermathecae small and simple (Figs 1–2).
                    
                    
                        Distribution.
                        Amamanganops gen. n. is known from a single specimen collected around San Jose, on the southern part of the island of Mindoro (Map 1). It is likely found on other parts of the island.

                            Etymology.
                            The specific epithet comes from the Buhid Mangyan word baginawa, meaning spider in the language of the indigenous people inhabiting the region of the type locality. The name is to be treated as a noun in apposition.

                            This species can be differentiated from all others by the very simple internal copulatory organs (Fig. 2). Males unknown.

                        Diagnosis.
                        Anyphops can be separated from all other genera by the ventral leg spination of Ti and Mt I and II, coupled with the collection locality. Specimens have either 4, 5, 6 or 7 paired ventral tibial spines and are found in Africa or Madagascar. If the tibial-metatarsal spination is 4–3 the spider is found in Africa and not Madagascar (see below under Remarks). In males, an additional character useful for diagnosis is the large, complex, sclerotized and often twisted MA.
                    
                    
                        Remarks.
                        Corronca (1998) described a single species of Anyphops from Madagascar, Anyphops benoiti. Anyphops had previously been known only from Africa while at the time only one genus, Hovops, had been described from Madagascar. Presumably Anyphops benoiti was included in the genus Anyphops due to the leg spination on the metatarsi and tarsi of legs I and II (5–3). In 2003, Corronca described a new genus, Garcorops, endemic to Madagascar. He mentioned differences between Anyphops and Garcorops, and that Garcorops seemed to be morphologically closest to the B1 group of Anyphops, as defined by Lawrence (1940) from Kenya and South Africa. Anyphops benoiti was not specifically mentioned in this paper. Although we have not examined specimens of Anyphops benoiti, Corronca’s illustration of the male palpus does not show the large, twisted median apophysis found in the majority of Anyphops species, but has a somewhat T-shaped conductor similar to that found in Garcorops, though Anyphops benoiti does not have the projection on the conductor that Garcorops has. The illustrations of the female copulatory organs are similar to both Anyphops and Garcorops. While it may seem that leg spination may not be a very strong character by which to separate genera, we would like to point out that in the molecular study of Crews and Gillespie (2010), while not having all genera discussed in the current paper available for genetic study, the genera Karaops gen. n., Garcorops, Hovops, and Anyphops were distinct in all analyses. After examining many other morphological characters in detail, the leg spination, coupled with biogeographical data and genetic data, appears to be the best way to distinguish genera at the present time given the specimens that are available.

                        Total length 4.00–17.40. Cephalothorax: Carapace with dark bands or spots laterally, wider than long or equally as long as wide, with cephalic portion more noticeable than in Selenops. Narrow fovea with six radiating lines. Setae are simple and sometimes spiniform. Median eyes strongly recurved, PME&gt;AME. Chelicerae slightly geniculate, robust, with 3 prolateral and 2 retrolateral teeth. Legs: Leg IV longer than leg II, and leg lengths are typically 4321. Tibiae I and II with pairs of 7, 6, 5 or 4 spines. Tarsal, and in some species, metatarsal scopulae present. Female copulatory organs: Epigynum with or without lateral lobes, with well defined median field, depression or septum. Epigynal pockets sometimes present. Spermathecae simple or complex. Male copulatory organs: Palpal cymbium with dense terminal scopulae. Palpal tibia with 2 tibial apophyses, dorsal larger than ventral. Dorsal apophysis twisted in some species, and in some species both branches bifurcated. MA complex, strongly sclerotized, angular, and twisted in some species.
                    
                    
                        Distribution.
                        Anyphops occurs throughout Africa, as well as on the islands of St. Helena and Madagascar.
                    
                    
                        Composition.
                        Currently there are 64 species of Anyphops described. Most species were first described as members of the genus Selenops by Lawrence (1940). Benoit (1968) transferred these into the genus Anyphops and described additional species. (Corronca (1998, 2000, 2005) described five more species, and re-described the lycosiformis group.

                            Garcorops Corronca 2003: 387. Type species: Garcorops madagascar Corronca, 2003, by original designation.
                        
                    
                    
                        Diagnosis.
                        Garcorops is easily separated from all other genera by the T-shaped conductor with a basally rounded projection. Females are best recognised from most other genera by the presence of 4 ventral pairs of spines on the tibiae and 3 pairs on the metatarsi, although there are some species of Anyphops with similar spination.
                    
                    
                        Description.
                        Total length 5.30–6.90. Cephalothorax: Carapace with some light markings, wider than long. Long narrow fovea with 6 radiating lines. Setae simple. Clypeus low. Eye rows recurved, with PME larger than AME. Chelicerae slightly geniculate, robust, with 3 prolateral and 2 retrolateral teeth. Legs: Leg IV longer than leg II. Tibiae and metatarsi with 4 and 3 pairs of ventral spines, respectively. Female copulatory organs: Epigynum with distinct lateral lobes in most species connected by a sclerotized bridge. Median field depressed, epigynal pockets absent, spermathecae complex. Male copulatory organs: Palpal tibia with 2 tibial apophyses, dorsal larger than ventral. MA unbranched and not sclerotized, conductor T-shaped with basally rounded projection.
                    
                    
                        Distribution.
                        Garcorops is found in Madagascar and the Comoros Islands.
                    
                    
                        Composition.
                        Currently there are three described extant species of Garcorops, Garcorops jocquei Corronca, 2003, Garcorops madagascar Corronca, 2003 and Garcorops paulyi Corronca, 2003, all recently described by Corronca (2003). A fourth species, Garcorops jadis, has been found in Madagascan copal, and was described by Bosselaers (2004). It has been suggested by Penney et al. (2005) that this could represent an ‘undiscovered’ extant species, or an extinct species.

                        Etymology.
                        Godumops gen. n comes from a combination of words and honors the indigenous peoples of Papua New Guinea. Although there are many different indigenous groups and languages in Papua New Guinea, we chose the Nobonob language, as this language is spoken around the type locality. Nobonob: Godum = spider; Greek: ops = face, eye. We retain the traditional ending of selenopid genera of ops, which originally referred to the eye arrangement. The gender is masculine.
                    
                    
                        Diagnosis.
                        Godumops gen. n.can be separated from all other genera by a combination of characters. In males, MA is lacking (Figs 5–6) with no distinct fovea and no radiating lines on the cephalothorax (Fig. 107). The terminal portion of the labium is also m-shaped (Fig. 109), whereas it is rounded in all other genera. Females unknown.
                    
                    
                        Description.
                        Total length 4.50. Cephalothorax: Carapace slightly darker on edges, longer than wide, fovea indistinct, round, extremely shallow, lacking radiating lines. Setae variable, ranging from soft, to thick and coarse, short peg-like spines to long and thin; some are of medium length and thickness. Both AER and PER slightly recurved. PME smaller than AME. Chelicerae slightly geniculate, robust, with three prolateral and 2 retrolateral teeth. Legs: Leg II is the longest, followed by III, IV and I. Tibial and metatarsal ventral spination is 7–4. Tarsal scopulae absent. Male copulatory organs: Palpal tibia with 2 tibial apophyses. Dorsal apophysis much longer than ventral apophysis. MA absent.

                            Holotype male: canopy fogging the tree Pometia pinnata in Baiteta Forest, 5°01'S, 145°45'E, Madang Province, Papua New Guinea, 31.III.1993, O. Missa (RMCA).
                        
                        
                            Etymology.
                            The specific epithet comes from the Latin word caritus, meaning lacking, devoid of, or poor, and refers to the near lack of a fovea, and lack of prosomal radiating lines, and the absence of a MA, which is found in all other known Selenopidae. The name is to be treated as an adjective.
                        
                        
                            Diagnosis.
                            This species can be separated from all other Selenopidae by a lack of MA (Fig. 1). Females unknown.

                        Hovops can be easily separated from all other genera by having the ventral tibial and metatarsal spination 2–2, as well as iridescent scales on the cephalothorax and abdomen.
                    
                    
                        Description.
                        Cephalothorax: Carapace with dark marks contrasting with white setae, longer than wide in most specimens. Fovea short and broad. Setae variable, iridescent scales present on cephalothorax and abdomen, some setae long and thin, some short and stiff. AER straight, PER slightly recurved. AME notably larger than PME, double in certain species. Chelicerae slightly geniculate, robust, with 3 prolateral and 2 retrolateral teeth. Legs: Tibial and metatarsal ventral spination is 2–2. Tarsal scopulae absent. Female copulatory organs: Epigynum variable. Male copulatory organs: Palpal tibia with 2 tibial apophyses, larger one curved, smaller one bent or dilated at base.

                        Composition.
                        There are currently six described species of Hovops: Hovops dufouri (Vinson, 1863), Hovops legrasi (Simon, 1887), Hovops madagascariensis (Vinson, 1863), Hovops mariensis (Strand, 1908), Hovops modestus (Lenz, 1886) and Hovops pusillus (Simon, 1887). This genus is in need of revision, as the newest species description is over 100 years old, with the other descriptions being 120–150 years old. The majority of species are described in separate publications and there are only two diagnostic drawings.

                        Etymology.
                        Karaops gen. n. comes from a combination of words and honors the indigenous peoples of Australia by referring to the indigenous Selenopidae found throughout the continent. Nyoongar: Kara = spider; Greek: ops = face, eye. We retain the traditional ending of selenopid genera of ops, which originally referred to the eye arrangement. The gender is masculine.
                    
                    
                        Diagnosis.
                        Karaops gen. n.can be separated from all other genera by a combination of characters: 1. ventral tibial and metatarsal spination of legs I and II something other than 3–2, 2. absence of scopulae, 3. found only in Australia. The males have a small, simple MA that is not twisted in any species.
                    
                    
                        Description.
                        Total length 3.90–10.30. Cephalothorax: Carapace with some dusky marks, usually wider than long. Fovea longitudinal, broad, and shallow. Setae variable, ranging from soft to thick and coarse, short peg-like spines to long and thin; some are of medium length and thickness. Chelicerae slightly geniculate, robust, with 3 prolateral and 2 retrolateral teeth, or 4 prolateral and 3 retrolateral teeth. Eyes: AER straight to slightly recurved to recurved, PER slightly recurved to strongly recurved. PME larger than AME in most species, though equal or smaller in some specimens. Legs: Leg III usually longest, though leg II or IV is longest in some species. Leg pattern 3241in most specimens, but is variable both between and within species, as in Selenops. Tibial and metatarsal ventral spination is primarily in pairs of 5 and 3, respectively, but can also be 6–3, 5–4, 6–4, 5–0, or are unpaired. Tarsal scopulae absent. Female copulatory organs: Epigynum with lateral lobes, a well-defined median area, and with or without epigynal pockets. Spermathecae and internal ducts range from simple and round to highly coiled. Male copulatory organs: Palpal tibia with 2 or 3 tibial apophyses. Dorsal apophysis longer than or equal to ventral apophysis in most species. MA 1 or 2 branched, ranging from unsclerotized to strongly sclerotized.
                    
                    
                        Remarks.
                        Species ofKaraops gen. n.can be locally abundant, but are relatively rare or at least elusive given the low numbers of species in museum collections.Although none have yet been determined to be short range endemics (SREs) (Harvey 2002), it is possible that with more thorough collecting in particular areas or with additional morphometric or molecular data, some will be found to be SREs. Many species are known only from one sex, and several species are known from only a single specimen.

                        In addition to transferring Selenops australiensis to Karaops gen. n., we describe 23 new species. It is likely that more species will be found. Given the large ranges of some species, yet seemingly stable morphology across isolated populations, molecular or morphometric data may reveal cryptic species.

                            Remarks.
                            The holotype from Bowen, north-eastern Queensland, is an immature (L. Koch 1875) and therefore unidentifiable to species level. We have assigned several adult specimens collected near Bowen to this species, in the assumption that only a single species occurs in the region. Although males and females have not been collected sympatrically, we have assigned them to the same species as they were collected less than 20 km apart.

                            Etymology.
                            The specific epithet comes from the indigenous word for Cooktown, the type locality, in the Guugu Yimithirr language.
                        
                        
                            Diagnosis.
                            Males can be distinguished from other species by a triangular projection directed basally coming off of the base of the embolus (Fig. 13) and females can be differentiated from others by the strongly coiled ducts and no distinctly swollen spermathecae (Fig. 12).

                            Etymology.
                            The specific name comes from the Nyoongar jarrit, meaning jarrah. Jarrah trees (Eucalyptus marginata) are common throughout the area where this species is found. The name is to be treated as a noun in apposition.
                        
                        
                            Diagnosis.
                            Males of this species can be separated from all other species except Karaops raveni sp. n. by having unpaired spines on Ti I and II, and can be separated from Karaops raveni by having the MA with a quadrangular base. Females can be separated from other species by the a diamond shaped median septum, small posterodorsal folds, and coiled internal ducts (Figs 23–26).

                            Remarks.
                            Though the male and female have not been collected together, it is clear from their morphologies that they are the same species. Additionally, and interestingly, this species is morphologically similar to Karaops raveni sp. n. and Karaops marrayagong sp. n. from eastern Australia. The cephalothorax of all three species is strongly flattened, giving the habitus a very truncate, or short and squat, appearance. The females have 5 paired spines on the ventral tibiae I and II, and 3 pairs on the metatarsi, whereas the male has either 4 or 5 spines (unpaired) on tibiae I and II, and no spines on the ventral surface of the metatarsi, though the male of Karaops marrayagong sp. n. is unknown.

                            Holotype female (AM KS19743): Kitty’s Creek [33°47'S, 151°08'E], near Sydney, New South Wales, Australia, 1916.
                        
                        
                            Etymology.
                            The specific epithet comes from the indigenous Dharug word for spider. Dharug is the language indigenous to the type locality. The name is to be treated as a noun in apposition.
                        
                        
                            Diagnosis.
                            This species can be separated from Karaops raveni sp. n. as the lateral lobes of the epigyne do not come into contact posteriorly, the ducts are narrower, and the spermathecae are closer together (Figs 27–28). Males unknown.
                        
                        
                            Remarks.
                            There is some ambiguity as to where exactly this specimen is from as it is rather old. The region of Kitty’s Creek in Sydney has been searched recently, but the area has been developed a great deal since the specimen was originally collected.

                            Etymology.
                            The specific epithet is in honor of Dr. Robert Raven from the Queensland Museum in recognition of his work on Australian spiders.
                        
                        
                            Diagnosis.
                            Males can be distinguished from all other males by having unpaired setae ventrally on tibiae I and II, and from Karaops jarrit sp. n. by having the MA with a quadrangular base (Figs 29–30). Females can be distinguished from other species by an almost downward-pointing arrow- shaped median septum and the lateral lobes coming into contact posteriorly (Figs 31–32).

                                Copulatory organs of Karaops raveni sp. n., male holotype from Brooyar State Forest, Queensland, Australia (QM S50593) (29–30), female paratype from Boat Mountain EP, Queensland, Australia (QM S47057) (31–32), and Karaops badgeradda sp. n., female holotype from Badgeradda Range, Muggon Station, Western Australia, Australia (WAM T97214) (23–34) 29 male pedipalp, ventral view 30 male pedipalp, retrolateral view 31, 33 epigyne, ventral view 32, 34 spermathecae, dorsal view.

                            Remarks.
                            Thus far, this is the most widespread species of Karaops gen. n. Although the copulatory organs were identical in all specimens examined, there is much morphological variation throughout the range of the species in somatic characters, and size. The female has paired tibial and metatarsal ventral spines on legs I and II, while in the male, the spines are unpaired on the tibiae and there are no spines on the metatarsi, as in Karaops jarrit sp. n. There also seems to be some variation in the number of cheliceral teeth present – typically the promargin has 4 teeth and the retromargin has 3 teeth, however, it may differ between the right and left sides of some specimens (e.g. L 4,2; R 4,3 or R 4,2; L 2,3).

                            Etymology.
                            The specific epithet comes from the type locality. The name is to be treated as a noun in apposition.
                        
                        
                            Diagnosis.
                            This species can be separated from all other species by genitalic characteristics, including a bilobed sclerotized area covering the copulatory openings located in the posterior third of the epigynal plate (Fig. 33). Males unknown.

                            Holotype male (WAM T55001): Bush Bay, site BB3, 25°04'40"S, 113°42'37"E, Western Australia, Australia, 16.I-23.V.1995, P.L. West et al., pitfall. Paratype: 1 female, same data as holotype (WAM T76700).
                        
                        
                            Etymology.
                            The specific name comes from the Yinggarda word karrawarla, meaning spider in the language of the indigenous Yinggarda people of the region. This name is to be treated as a noun in apposition.
                        
                        
                            Diagnosis.
                            Males can be differentiated from other species by having a palpal conductor with a long, fleshy terminal process (Fig. 39). Females can be distinguished from other species by having distinct lateral lobes, and a bilobed sclerotized area covering the copulatory openings in the upper third of the epigynal plate (Fig. 41).

                            Etymology.
                            The specific name comes from the Kurrama word martamarta, meaning red in the language of the indigenous Kurrama people of the region, and refers to the red color of this species (Fig 93). The name is to be treated as a noun in apposition.
                        
                        
                            Diagnosis.
                            Females of this species can be differentiated from all others by the indistinct median septum and lateral lobes, and the median field being a long, narrow depression, with round spermathecae, and the sperm ducts nearly touch medially (Figs 45–46). Male is unknown.

                            Etymology.
                            The specific name comes from the Adnyamathanha words vadla, meaning flat, and adambara, meaning spider, in the language of the indigenous Adnyamathanha people of the region of the type locality. The name is to be treated as a noun in apposition.
                        
                        
                            Diagnosis.
                            Males can be differentiated from all other species by having a portion of the conductor behind the MA, and the conductor being sclerotized terminally. Additionally, the embolus is short and hook shaped, and in the center of the bulb rather than the lateral edge (Fig. 51). Females can be separated from other species by a quadrangular medium septum and well-separated, round spermathecae and short copulatory ducts (Figs 53–54).

                            Etymology.
                            The specific epithet comes from the Latin word desertum which is a waste place or a wilderness and is an adjective that denotes the presence of this species in desert biotopes.
                        
                        
                            Diagnosis.
                            Females can be differentiated from other species by the median septum of the copulatory organs tapering posteriorly, giving it a subtriangular appearance (Fig. 59). Males unknown.

                            Type material.
                            Holotype male (SAM NN10914): 8 km northeast of Mount Woodroffe, South Australia, Australia, in gorge, 26°17'S, 131°48'E, 15.X.1994, D. Hirst. Paratype: 2.5 km southwest of Womikata Bore Homeland, South Australia, Australia, 26°07'S, 132°08'E, 20.X.1994, D. Hirst, 1♀ (SAM NN10915).
                        
                        
                            Etymology.
                            The specific epithet refers to the indigenous Pitjantjatjara name for Mount Woodroofe, the type locality. The name is to be treated as a noun in apposition.
                        
                        
                            Diagnosis.
                            Males of this species can be differentiated from others by having a sinuate anterior margin of the conductor, having two branches on the MA, and a hook-shaped embolus that bisects the palpal bulb (Fig. 61). The females can also be separated from other species by having a keyhole-shaped median septum, and lateral lobes nearly touching posteriorly (Fig. 63).
                        
                        
                            Remarks.
                            Although the male and female specimens were not collected together (they were collected some 46 km apart), it seems reasonable to assume they are conspecific.

                            Etymology.
                            This species is named in honor of the second author’s (MSH) daughter, Frances Harvey.
                        
                        
                            Diagnosis.
                            Males of this species can be separated from others, in particular Karaops toolbrunup sp. n., by having the tip of the cymbium rounded and the embolus curving around the outer edge of the cymbium (Fig. 65). Females can be separated from other species by having epigynal pockets and the internal ducts (Figs 67–68).

                            Remarks.
                            Throughout its range, this species is subject to variation in body size, ventral tibial and metatarsal spination of legs I and II, as well as in the number of promarginal teeth. There are 6 pairs of spines ventrally on tibiae I and II in most specimens, but some specimens have 5 pairs. Typically, there are 4 pairs of spines located ventrally on the metatarsus, however, at least one specimen has a 2–2-1 pattern. This species has either 4 or 5 promarginal teeth. The leg lengths also vary a great deal and have been found to be 3421, 23=41, 3241 and 2341. There is no genitalic variation.

                            Etymology.
                            The specific epithet refers to the type locality, which means ‘drizzle carrier’ in the indigenous Nyoongar language. The name is to be treated as a noun in apposition.
                        
                        
                            Diagnosis.
                            This species can be separated from most others by having 4 teeth on the cheliceral promargin, and from Karaops francesae sp. n. by genitalic characteristics. In the male, the cymbium is pointed distally, and the base of the embolus extends to the basal margin of the cymbium (Fig. 71). In the female, epigynal pockets are present and the sperm ducts are not coiled (Figs 69–70).

                            Diagnosis.
                            Males of this species can be separated from others by the irregular shaped and unsclerotized MA, and the conductor has a pointed projection terminally (Fig. 73). Females of this species can be distinguished from others by the medially located copulatory organs and the widely spaced epigynal pockets (Fig. 75).

                            This species can be distinguished from all others by having an abdominal pattern of light spots on a dark background, and by the copulatory organs, as the lateral lobes come into contact for nearly half of the length of the epigynal plate, and the copulatory ducts are long, laterally positioned, and lead to a mass of winding ducts (Figs 79–80). Males unknown.

                            Natural history.
                            This species has been found on Pandanus, under the fronds where they attach to the trunk, as well as under the leaves, and under bark of a log on the ground (Fig. 102).

                        Selenops montigenus Simon, 1889.
                    
                    
                        Etymology.
                        Makdiops comes from a combination of words and is from the indigenous language of the region in which this genus is found. Hindi: मकड़ी = makdi (romanization) =spider; Greek: ops = face, eye. We retain the traditional ending of selenopid genera of ops, which originally referred to the eye arrangement. The gender is masculine.
                    
                    
                        Diagnosis.
                        Makdiops gen. n.can be separated from all other genera by a combination of characters. The ventral spination of the tibiae and metatarsi is 4–3, 3–3, or 3–2, there are no tarsal scopulae, and the genus is only found from India and Nepal.
                    
                    
                        Remarks.
                        Here we describe two new species, move three species from Selenops to Makdiops gen. n. (Makdiops montigenus comb. n., Makdiops agumbensis comb. n., Makdiops nilgirensis comb. n.), redescribe Makdiops montigenus comb. n., including the first description of the male.
                        It appears that at least two genera, Makdiops gen. n.and Selenops, occur throughout the Indo-Asian region (Map 1, Map 3). The species of Selenops include Selenops radiatus, the most widespread selenopid species, Selenops sumitrae Patel & Patel, 1973, and Selenops shevaroyensis Gravely, 1931. We were unable to examine specimens of the latter two species, however the published descriptions and illustrations of Selenops sumitrae (Patel & Patel 1973) make it difficult to differentiate from Selenops radiatus, and if it is not a synonym, they are certainly very closely related. The description and illustration of Selenops shevaroyensis are inadequate (Gravely 1931) and the type is not available. At this time, we will make no taxonomic changes to this species, pending the collection of new material.
                        It is likely that several more species from this region will be found with further exploration, and it is of note that the male of only one species of Makdiops gen. n. is known. Most of these are known from only a single specimen, and in cases where they are not, there seems to be a lot of variation. While it is possible that these species may represent more than one genus, at this time, we will group them together based on their geographic locations, genitalic similarities, and lack of tarsal scopulae.
                    
                    
                        Description.
                        Total length 6.70–9.70. Cephalothorax: Carapace with some dark spots or dusky markings, wider than long. Fovea longitudinal, short, broad, and shallow. Setae variable, ranging from short and spine-like, to long and thin; some are of medium length and thickness. AER straight, PER slightly recurved to recurved. PME larger than AME. Chelicerae slightly geniculate, robust, with 3 prolateral and 2 retrolateral teeth. Legs: Leg II or III longest, with III usually longer than IV. Tibial and metatarsal ventral spination variable, either 4–3, 3–3, or 3–2. Tarsal scopulae absent. Female copulatory organs: Epigynum with lateral lobes, a well-defined median area, and with or without epigynal pockets. Spermathecae range from being simple and not coiled, to some coiling, to extremely coiled and asymmetrical. Posterodorsal fold present or not. Male copulatory organs: The male of only one species is known. Palpal tibia with 1 tibial bifid apophysis. Dorsal portion longer, thin and slightly curved; ventral portion shorter and flattened; MA small, simple and single-branched; Conductor large, T-shaped, pointed retrolaterally.
                    
                    
                        Distribution.
                        Makdiops gen. n.occurs throughout India and Nepal (Map 3). It has been found at a higher elevation than any other selenopid species, at over 2500 m. It is likely to be found in other countries throughout the region (Map 3).

                            Remarks.
                            We were unable to examine the type of Makdiops agumbensis comb. n. From the description and illustrations (Tikader 1969), it is impossible to tell whether or not it is valid, or whether it is indeed a unique species. However, the description suggests it is a species of Makdiops rather than Selenops, viz,tibiae I and II have 4 pairs of ventral spines, the epigyne has large epigynal pockets, and the genital openings are located behind a sinuous margin (Tikader 1969; fig. 2).

                            Etymology.
                            The specific epithet comes from the Kannada word ಮೈಸೂರ = Maisūru referring to Mahishasura, a Hindu asura, for which the city of Mysore, or the region of the type locality, was named. The name is to be treated as a noun in apposition.
                        
                        
                            Diagnosis.
                            This species can be differentiated from all others by a combination of characters including tibiae I and II with three pairs of ventral spines, sperm ducts only coiled a few times, and ducts symmetrical (Fig. 86). Males unknown.

                        Etymology.
                        Pakawops gen. n. comes from a combination of words and honors the indigenous peoples of Taiwan and refers to the indigenous selenopid known to occur on the island. Though there were many different indigenous languages of Taiwan, we chose the extinct East Formosan Basay language, as the type locality is within area the Basay peoples once inhabited. Basay: Pakaw = spider; Greek: ops = face, eye. We retain the traditional ending of selenopid genera of ops, which originally referred to the eye arrangement. The gender is masculine.
                    
                    
                        Diagnosis.
                        Pakawops gen. n.can be separated from all other genera by the presence of 7 pairs of ventral spines on tibiae I and II, and 5 pairs on metatarsi I and II in combination with being found in Taiwan.
                    
                    
                        Remarks.
                        Although we have not examined specimens of this species, the published descriptions (Kayashima 1943a, b) show it to be clearly different from any other genus of Selenopidae. Kayashima (1943a) mentions that it is similar to Selenops radiatus, though it differs in the ventral tibial and metatarsal spination and is much smaller.

                                Siamspinops Dankittipakul and Corronca 2009: 69. Type species: Siamspinops spinosissimus, Dankittipakul and Corronca, 2009, by original designation.
                            
                        
                        
                            Diagnosis.
                            Siamspinops females can beseparated from those of all other genera by the combination of highly coiled spermathecae and by the presence of a posterodorsal epigynal fold. Some members of Karaops gen. n. also have strongly coiled ducts, but are lacking the posterodorsal fold. Males can be easily separated by having extremely strongly forward projecting chelicerae and long fangs. No other genus of selenopid has these characters.
                        
                        
                            Description.
                            Total length 6.00–7.90. Cephalothorax: Carapace with some dusky marks, wider than long. Short, broad, shallow fovea. Setae simple. AER straight, PER recurved. AME smaller than PME. Chelicerae slightly geniculate and robust in female; chelicerae and fangs in male are very long and strongly projecting forward; with 3 prolateral and 2 retrolateral teeth. Legs: Leg II is longer than leg IV, with leg III longest in females; tibiae I and II with 11–15 paired ventral spines, metatarsi I and II with 7–13 paired ventral spines; tarsal scopulae present. Female copulatory organs: Epigynum with or without lateral lobes, with median field and epigynal pockets. Spermathecae heavily sclerotized and coiled, with 7–14 spirals, posterodorsal fold present. Male copulatory organs: Palpal tibia with 2 tibial apophyses; embolus long and filiform; conductor T-shaped with one tip pointed;MA with only one branch, simple, and hook-shaped.
                        
                        
                            Distribution.
                            Siamspinops occurs in Southeast Asia from Thailand, south to Malaysia (Map 1).
                        
                        
                            Composition.
                            Four species, Siamspinops allospinosus, Siamspinops spinescens, Siamspinops spinosissimus, Siamspinops spinosus which were all recently described by Dankittipakul and Corronca (2009), and we transfer one species, Selenops aculeatus, to Siamspinops, and redescribe this species, bringing the total number of species to five. It is likely there are many more species in the region.

                        Diagnosis.
                        The female of this species can be easily distinguished from all others by the copulatory organs, as the sperm ducts are coiled 16 times, and a posterodorsal fold is present (Fig. 4). Male unknown.
                    
                    
                        Remarks.
                        Selenops aculeatus comb. n. is assigned to Siamspinops based on the morphology of the numerous spermathecal coils and the very spiny legs (Dankittipakul and Corronca 2009).
