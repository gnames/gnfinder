"Grey" dictionaries
-------------------

`genera.txt`

Contains ambiguous genera and their species. The idea is to use them together
so if there is a known species with ambiguous genera -- we assume it is a real
name

`species.txt`

List of all ambiguous species names. We would assume they are real species if
they appear together with known genus

`uninomials.txt`

List of 3 ambiguous uninomial names
