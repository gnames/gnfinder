                Abstract
                Recently, we completed a revision of the Termitidae from New Guinea and neighboring islands, recording a total of 45 species. Here, we revise a second family, the Rhinotermitidae, to progress towards a full picture of the termite diversity in New Guinea. Altogether, 6 genera and 15 species are recorded, among which two species, Coptotermes gambrinus and Parrhinotermes barbatus, are new to science. The genus Heterotermes is reported from New Guinea for the first time, with two species restricted to the southern part of the island. We also provide the first New Guinea records for six species of the genera Coptotermes and Schedorhinotermes. We briefly describe soldiers and imagoes of each species and provide a key based on soldier characters. Finally, we discuss the taxonomic and biogeographical implication of our results. A replacement name, Schedolimulus minutides Bourguignon, is proposed  for the termitophilous staphylinid Schedolimulus minutus Bourguignon, to solve a question of secondary homonymy.

            Introduction
            The Rhinotermitidae constitute one of the most widespread termite families, including numerous pest species. First established under the invalid name Mesotermitidae (Holmgren 1910a, b), then reestablished as Rhinotermitidae by Light (1921), the family originally included all termites possessing a fontanelle and a frontal gland in the imago and soldier castes, 8 malpighian tubules and hindgut with short anterior (pre-paunch) sections. Later on, the Stylotermitidae and Serritermitidae were separated as distinct families (Chatterjee and Thakur 1964, Emerson 1965), a position recently endorsed by Engel et al. (2009). The Rhinotermitidae now comprise several genera of uncertain affinities, such as Prorhinotermes, Termitogeton and Psammotermes, and two well-supported clades: (i) the Rhinotermitinae, including Parrhinotermes, Schedorhinotermes and the neotropical Rhinotermes-group; (ii) the Heterotermitinae + Coptotermitinae, comprising Reticulitermes, Heterotermes and Coptotermes. As presently defined, the Rhinotermitidae might still be paraphyletic with respect to the Serritermitidae or Termitidae, but the actual phylogeny of this group remains uncertain (Lo et al. 2004, Ohkuma et al. 2004, Inward et al. 2007).
            The Rhinotermitidae are widely distributed across tropical, subtropical and temperate regions (Eggleton 2000). Whereas the genus Prorhinotermes is notable for its pantropical insular distribution (Emerson 1952), other genera are either pantropical (e.g. Coptotermes) or limited to one (e.g. Termitogeton) or a few zoogeographic areas (e.g. Schedorhinotermes). In southeast Asia, the Rhinotermitidae are represented by six genera: Parrhinotermes, Schedorhinotermes, Coptotermes, Heterotermes, Prorhinotermes and Termitogeton. All but the last one are also present in Australia. The former two belong to the subfamily Rhinotermitinae, whose soldiers are equipped to bite and smear a poisonous liquid with their elongated brush-like labrum (Quennedey and Deligne 1975). In the other genera, soldiers can simultaneously bite and emit a toxic or sticky chemical secretion from their frontal gland (Prestwich 1979, Šobotník et al. 2010a). Alates are also equipped with a frontal gland, variously developed according to the genus (Šobotník et al. 2010b).
            Some recent revisions or compilations of distributional data are available for Rhinotermitidae in Southeast Asia and Australia. Faunal lists mention 21 species from Sundaland (Peninsular Malaysia to Borneo: Gathorne-Hardy 2004), 12 from Sulawesi (Gathorne-Hardy et al. 2000), 24 from Australia (Watson et al. 1998). However, prior to the beginning of our survey in 1978, only five species in two genera were known from New Guinea: Coptotermes elisae (Desneux, 1905), Coptotermes obiratus Hill, 1927, Schedorhinotermes dimorphus (Desneux, 1905), Schedorhinotermes translucens (Haviland, 1898), and Schedorhinotermes celebensis (Holmgren, 1911a). Prorhinotermes inopinatus Silvestri, 1909, was reported more recently (Gay and Barrett 1983). Findings of Prorhinotermes (identified as Prorhinotermes inopinatus), Parrhinotermes (as Parrhinotermes browni (Harris, 1958)) and Termitogeton (as Termitogeton nr. planus (Haviland, 1898)) were mentioned in studies focused on caste patterns (Roisin 1988a, b, Parmentier and Roisin 2003), bringing the total number of New Guinean species to 8 in 5 genera. The present revision is primarily based on extensive collections carried out in New Guinea between 1978 and 1995. We recorded 15 species in 6 genera, among which 2 species are new to science. The present work complements our series of monographic revisions on New Guinean Termitidae, in which we recorded a total of 45 species in 13 genera (Roisin 1990, Roisin and Pasteels 1996, 2000, Bourguignon et al. 2008).
        
        
            Materials and methods
            
                Biological material
                Extensive termite collecting was carried out by J. M. Pasteels (in collection records: JMP), Y. Roisin (YR) and M. Leponce (ML) in New Guinea and some neighboring islands between 1978 and 1995 although records from Indonesian Papua are almost exclusively limited to the “bird’s neck” area, around Nabire and Kaimana (Figs 30, 82). Termite specimens were collected with tweezers and preserved in 80% alcohol or fixed in Bouin’s fluid or in a formol-alcohol-acetic acid (20:75:5) mixture. We also had the opportunity to examine samples collected in alcohol by Alfred E. and Eleanor Emerson in 1962–1963 (AE), as well as a few samples from other sources. Localities where specimens were collected are given as well as their approximate geographic coordinates (Appendix 1), obtained by cross-checking maps, GoogleTM Earth positioning and the National Geospatial Agency GEOnet Names Server (http://geonames.nga.mil/ggmagaz/).
            
            
                Systematic characters
                This study is based on the morphology of soldier and alate castes. Soldiers supply most of the important taxonomic information at the species level. The following characters are of major interest: size, general shape of the head, shape of mandibles, shape of postmentum, pilosity of head and number of antennal articles. Alates, when available, may give taxonomic information at the species level by the general shape of their head and pronotum.

                    Imago head circular, covered by many setae. Fontanelle indistinct and appearing as a small spot in the middle of the head. Large ocelli located above the eyes. Pronotum and abdomen densely hairy. Soldiers with pyriform head capsule, slightly hairy. Fontanelle very large, directed forward, through which the latex-like secretion of the frontal gland is discharged. Labrum short, triangular-shaped. Mandibles narrow and elongated, curved at tip; right mandible without subsidiary teeth and serrations; left one with a basal tooth and serrations. Antennae with 12 to 16 articles.
                
                
                    Distribution.
                    The genus Coptotermes is broadly distributed, occurring in all tropical and subtropical regions. It comprises species adapted to all major biomes, from tropical rainforest to arid steppes and deserts. Nests are generally found in logs, in the heartwood of living trees, or underground (Emerson 1971). Several species, such as Coptotermes formosanus, are major pests of buildings (Su and Scheffrahn 2000).

It has also been reported from the following localities, but the relevant material was not examined: Bukaua (as Coptotermes hyaloapex: Holmgren 1911a), Popondetta (Gay 1963). According to Gathorne-Hardy (2004), it is present from Peninsular Malaysia throughout Sundaland.

                    Comparisons.
                    This species shows variation in size along its distribution range although no consistent characters allowed us to split it up. Coptotermes remotus most resembles the Australian species Coptotermes lacteus and the Malayan ones Coptotermes bentongensis and Coptotermes sepangensis. These last two species occur in sympatry and are morphologically undistinguishable, making them probable synonyms. Soldiers of Coptotermes remotus can be distinguished from other New Guinean species by their small size and mandibles curved at the tip.
                
                
                    Distribution.
                    This species, originally described from Kavieng, New Ireland, is widespread throughout New Guinean forests. It is abundant in the bird’s neck area of Indonesian Papua, but only a few specimens were collected from Papua New Guinea (Fig. 31).

                    In his revision of termites from Australia, Hill (1942) mentioned that soldiers of Coptotermes grandiceps and Coptotermes obiratus are morphologically indistinguishable, the two species being potential synonyms. After examining material of the two species, we reached the same conclusion and therefore consider Coptotermes obiratus as a junior synonym of Coptotermes grandiceps.

                    Comparisons.
                    This species is closely related and imperfectly separated from Coptotermes grandiceps. However, the size and morphological differences between the two species are high enough to retain them as distinct taxa, even though some individuals cannot be unambiguously assigned. The same was already observed in the related Australian species Coptotermes acinaciformis Froggatt, which is believed to form a species complex (Brown et al. 1990). The main criteria differentiating Coptotermes pamuae from Coptotermes grandiceps are its smaller soldiers with less hairy pronotum and less curved mandibles.

                    Etymology.
                    We named this species in honor of Gambrinus, a legendary character from Flanders, famous for enjoying life.

                    Diagnosis.
                    Imago head roughly oval, narrower anteriorly than posteriorly. Fontanelle small, located in the middle of the head. Eyes small and flat. Ocelli situated in front of the head, before eyes. Antennae generally with 15 to 19 articles. Pronotum elongated, narrower than head. Soldier head long and narrow, rectangular-shaped. Fontanelle small, circular, situated forward. Labrum short to medium-sized, about half as long as mandibles. Mandibles sabre-shaped, slightly curved at tips. Left mandible with a tooth and some serrations at the base. Right mandible without basal tooth and serrations. Antennae with 13 to 18 articles.
                
                
                    Distribution.
                    Most species of Heterotermes are tropical (Emerson 1971). This genus was known from the Neotropics, northern Africa, Asia (from the Arabic peninsula to Indonesia), and Australia, occurring from humid forests to desert edges. Here, we extend its known distribution to southern New Guinea.

                    New synonymy.
                    Hill (1942) pointed out the similarity of Heterotermes venustus and Heterotermes vagus, but maintained both names arguing that Heterotermes venustus has a larger labrum and antennae with more articles. However, after comparing the type series of both species, we did not notice any difference in these characters, nor in any other morphological feature. For this reason, we consider these two species as synonyms and hereby give precedence to Heterotermes vagus.

                    Morphological variation occurs along the distribution range of Heterotermes paradoxus, though it appears insufficient to recognize distinct species. Heterotermes paradoxus differs from Heterotermes vagus by the larger size of its soldiers, its less elongated labrum with rounded end and its antennae with 16 or 17 articles.

                    Comparisons.
                    This species is distinguishable from Parrhinotermes browni and Parrhinotermes queenslandicus Mjöberg, 1920 by the postmentum of soldiers, completely covered by setae.
                
                
                    Distribution.
                    (Fig. 55). This species is common in southern New Guinean forests, and was also collected once in Indonesian Papua.
                
                
                    Termitophiles.
                    The four species of Parrhinopsenius found with Parrhinotermes browni were also found with this species, previously referred to as Parrhinotermes nr. queenslandicus (Bourguignon et al. 2007).
                
                
                    Etymology.
                    We named this species after the latin “barba”, referring to the postmentum of its soldiers fully covered by setae.

                    Diagnosis.
                    Imagoes very similar to those of Parrhinotermes. Head approximately circular in shape. Fontanelle situated in the middle of the head. Frons with a slightly visible groove. Labrum short, inclined downward, without groove. Soldiers generally dimorphic and sometimes trimorphic. All species described here have dimorphic soldiers, excepted Schedorhinotermes seclusus in which the minor soldiers can sometimes be further separated into two morphs (Miller 1987). Minor soldiers with elongated head. Frons and clypeus with a groove in the middle that joins the opening of the fontanelle to the labrum. Labrum elongated, crossed by a groove in the middle, ending in a brush. Mandibles long and slender. Left mandible with two short subsidiary teeth. Right mandible with one short subsidiary tooth. Major soldiers with labrum proportionally shorter than in minor soldiers. Frons and clypeus with a groove in the middle, from the fontanelle to the labrum. Labrum short and large, with a groove in the middle and an apical brush. Mandibles stout and strongly curved. Left mandible with two large subsidiary teeth. Right mandible with one large subsidiary tooth, as well as a hump at the base. Major soldiers supply more relevant systematic information to distinguish species.
                
                
                    Distribution.
                    This genus is known from Africa, Southeast Asia, the Papuan region and Australia (Emerson 1955, Harris 1968). It feeds on dead wood.

                    Comparisons.
                    This species is easily distinguishable from others by its large size and its densely hairy abdomen in the minor and major soldier castes. Minor soldiers are highly variable in size, indicating the likely presence of two developmental subcategories (Miller 1987).

                    New synonymy.
                    We compared the type material of Schedorhinotermes longirostris and Schedorhinotermes dimorphus with our material and were not able to find any relevant morphological characters to distinguish the two species. Therefore, we consider Schedorhinotermes dimorphus as a junior synonym of Schedorhinotermes longirostris.

                    Several Aleocharinae (Coleoptera, Staphylinidae) were found with this species. Schedotermoecia kaimanensis (Coptotermoeciina) was described from colony #IRJT142, and its congener Schedotermoecia papuana from #PNGT1165 (Bourguignon and Roisin 2006). The following Trichopseniini also occur with this species: Schedolimulus elongatus, Schedotermoecia planus and Schedotermoecia minutides Bourguignon, nomen novum (here proposed as replacement name for Schedotermoecia minutus Bourguignon, 2007, to remove secondary homonymy with Phorilimulus minutus Pasteels & Kistner, 1971, transferred to Schedolimulus by Kanao et al. 2011).

                    New synonymy.
                    Schedorhinotermes celebensis was described by Holmgren (1911a) based on the alate caste. The distinction of rhinotermitid species based only on alates is uncertain, as only few characters give relevant taxonomic information. After comparison of the type series of Schedorhinotermes celebensis and Schedorhinotermes translucens it appears that alates of the two species are morphologically identical and could be considered as the same species. Moreover, Schedorhinotermes celebensis was mentioned in New Guinea and was therefore expected to occur in our samples. Thus, even though the soldiers could not be compared, we consider Schedorhinotermes celebensis as a junior synonym of Schedorhinotermes translucens.
                    Schedorhinotermes marjoriae was described by Snyder (1925) based on specimens collected in the Solomon Islands. He pointed out its resemblance with Schedorhinotermes translucens and gave as sole character to distinguish these species the morphology of major soldier mandibles. After examination of samples of Schedorhinotermes marjoriae and Schedorhinotermes translucens, we found that differences between soldier mandibles of the two alleged species are by far smaller than variation observed among New Guinean specimens. For this reason, we also consider Schedorhinotermes marjoriae as a junior synonym of Schedorhinotermes translucens.

                    This species is related to Schedorhinotermes longirostris, from which it can be distinguished by its more hairy pronotum, mesonotum, metanotum and abdomen of major soldiers.
                
                
                    Distribution.
                    (Fig. 83). Schedorhinotermes translucens is widespread throughout New Guinea, both in savannas and forests. The following additional records are from the literature (samples not examined): Holmgren (1911a): Sattelberg, Kola; as Schedorhinotermes celebensis: Aitape (as Eitape (Berlinerhafen)); Roonwal and Maiti (1966): Meervlakte.

                    Note on type species designation.
                    Snyder (1949) mentioned Termes umbilicatus Hagen, 1858, as type species of Termitogeton. However, Desneux (1904a) explicitly based the original description of the subgenus Termitogeton on Termes planus. In this paper, he mentions Termes umbilicatus only once, stating that Termes planus “est probablement synonyme de Termes umbilicatus Hagen”. That two species are considered probable synonyms by an author does not automatically imply that this author has no doubt about their subgeneric assignment. Consequently, Termes umbilicatus should be considered as doubtfully included in Termitogeton, and ineligible for type species fixation (Art. 67.2.5 of the Code). Termitogeton Desneux should therefore be considered as monotypic when established, Termes planus becoming automatically the type species. The fact that Desneux (1904b) subsequently mentioned Termes umbilicatus as single valid species of Termes (Termitogeton), with Termes planus as a ?-marked junior synonym, is irrelevant.
                
                
                    Diagnosis.
                    Imagoes densely hairy. Head larger posteriorly than anteriorly. Fontanelle very narrow, placed in the middle of the head. Eyes small. Antennae with 10 to 15 articles. Pronotum very small, half as broad as head. Wings without median and radial vein (Krishna 1970). Soldiers densely hairy, with characteristic heart-shaped, dorso-ventrally flattened head. Antennae generally with 13 to 15 articles. Labrum roughly triangular-shaped. Mandibles elongated, without marginal teeth. Pronotum half as broad as head.
                
                
                    Distribution.
                    Termitogeton is a rainforest-dwelling wood feeder known from Sri Lanka, Borneo, Peninsular Malaysia (Tho 1992) and western New Guinea (Parmentier and Roisin 2003).

            Discussion
            This study reveals that the richness of Rhinotermitidae in New Guinea is much higher than the 8 species previously recognized. Overall, we found 6 genera and 15 species, a diversity which appears slightly lower than that of neighboring areas such as Peninsular Malaysia (6 genera, 24 species (Tho 1992)), Sabah (6 genera, 19 species (Thapa 1982)) and Australia (5 genera, 23 species (Watson and Abbey 1998)). However, these richness figures deserve closer scrutiny, because several species are known only from their original description. Furthermore, the Rhinotermitidae display several characteristics predisposing them to synonymy. (i) In several genera, soldiers may be derived from a series of larval or worker instars, producing a substantial variation in size and number of antennal articles (Hanus et al. 2006). Differences are especially conspicuous between incipient and mature colonies. Therefore, these criteria, though frequently used, are of limited value for species discrimination. (ii) Wood feeders are generally good dispersers and can easily cross salt water gaps by rafting (Eggleton and Tayasu 2001). Extensive colonization of islands and large intercolonial variability favored multiple descriptions of single species under different names along their distribution range. Some pruning, as initiated by Gathorne-Hardy (2004) who placed 11 species of Rhinotermitidae from Sundaland and the western Pacific into synonymy, is clearly needed. On the other hand, the existence of cryptic species has been documented in several Rhinotermitidae (Heterotermes, Watson et al. 1989; Coptotermes, Brown et al. 1990; Reticulitermes, Copren et al. 2005) and Termitidae (Macrotermes, Bagine et al. 1994; Cubitermes, Roy et al. 2006), so that morphologically homogenous taxa might have to be split when submitted to detailed chemical or molecular analyses.
            The distribution patterns of rhinotermitid species match those found in termitids (Roisin 1990, Roisin and Pasteels 1996, 2000, Bourguignon et al. 2008). The central mountain range constitutes a barrier for several species, as in the genus Parrhinotermes where Parrhinotermes browni occurs almost exclusively on the north slope, while Parrhinotermes barbatus occurs in the south. In a similar way, Heterotermes is completely missing in the northern part of New Guinea but is represented by two species, also present in Australia, in the south, like the nasute genus Niuginitermes (Roisin and Pasteels 1996). Interestingly, northern and southern species meet in the bird’s neck area, where several low valleys connect the two coasts. A second barrier shaping termite species distribution in New Guinea is the ecotone between southern Papuan savannas and the forest-covered areas to the north. Typically, the invertebrate fauna of Papuan savannas shows close affinities with that of northern Australia, whereas forested areas of New Guinea mainly harbor species with Oriental affinities (Gressitt 1982). This situation is illustrated by Heterotermes vagus and Coptotermes pamuae, which were only found in southern Papuan savannas but also occur in Australia (Hill 1942). Among the Termitidae, at least 11 species (e.g., Amitermes arboreus, Nasutitermes triodiae, Microcerotermes taylori, Lophotermes aduncus) are in this case (Roisin 1990, Miller 1994, Roisin and Pasteels 1996, 2000, Bourguignon et al. 2008). Fewer species inhabiting Papuan and northern Australian savannas penetrate deep into southern forests, but Schedorhinotermes seclusus and the termitid Ephelotermes cheeli do (Bourguignon et al 2008). Heterotermes paradoxus was also found in forests in the bird’s neck area. East-west patterns are less conspicuous than north-south ones, but some termitid species show a longitude-restricted range: the genus Hospitalitermes, of clear oriental origin, was not found east of Nomad (Roisin and Pasteels 1996), whereas Microcerotermes piliceps is restricted to eastern Papua New Guinea and islands further east (Roisin and Pasteels 2000). Here, two species known from as far west as the Malay peninsula, Schedorhinotermes malaccensis and Termitogeton planus, were recorded only from the bird’s neck area, but their eastern limits are unknown due to the near absence of termite samples from the huge area between the bird’s neck region and the Papua New Guinean border (141° E meridian).
            We expect the rhinotermitid diversity found in this study to reflect the overall richness of the island, although it is inevitable that some rare or locally distributed taxa escaped detection. Two regions are particularly likely to host undiscovered taxa: (i) southern Papuan savannas, in which our collecting effort was limited, possibly host additional taxa of Australian affinities; (ii) as stated above, the western half of New Guinea (Indonesian Papua) was also poorly explored and is therefore likely to conceal further taxa of Oriental origin, in the vein of Termitogeton planus and Schedorhinotermes malaccensis.
