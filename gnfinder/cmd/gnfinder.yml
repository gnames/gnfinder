# BayesOddsThreshold sets the limit of posterior odds. Everything higher

# Format output format for finding results. Possible formats are

# csv - CSV output
# compact - JSON in one line
# pretty - JSON with new lines and indentations.

# Format: csv

# IncludeInputText can be set to true if the user wants to get back the text
# used for name-finding. This feature is epspecilly useful if original file
# was a PDF, MS Word, HTML etc. and a user wants to use OffsetStart and
# OffsetEnd indices to find names in the text.

# Language that is prevalent in the text. This setting helps to get
# a better result for NLP name-finding, because languages differ in their

# Currently only the following languages are supported:

# Language: eng

# PreferredSources is a list of data-source IDs used for the
# name-verification. These data-sources will always be matched with the
# verified names. You can find the list of all data-sources at
# https://verifier.globalnames.org/api/v1/data_sources.
# When this option is not empty, verification is switched on automatically.
# Example - [1, 11]
#
# PreferredSources: []

# TikaURL contains the URL of Apache Tika service. This service is used
# for extraction of UTF8-encoded texts from a variety of file formats.
#
# TikaURL: https://tika.globalnames.org

# TokensAround sets the number of tokens (words) before and after each
# name-candidate. These words will be returned with the output.
# The acceptable range is from 0 to 5.
# This option is ignored if WithUniqueNames is true.
#
# TokensAround: 0

# VerifierURL contains the URL of a name-verification service.

# VerifierURL: https://verifier.globalnames.org/api/v1/

# WithBayesOddsDetails show in detail how odds are calculated.
# This option is ignores if Format is set to csv.
#
# WithBayesOddsDetails: false

# WithLanguageDetection can be set to true, if a user wants to detect
# the language of a text automatically.
#
# WithLanguageDetection: false

# WithOddsAdjustment can be set to true to adjust calculated odds using the
# ratio of scientific names found in text to the number of capitalized
# words.
#
# WithOddsAdjustment: false

# WithPlainInput flag can be set to true if the input is a plain
# UTF8-encoded text. In this case file is read directly instead of going
# through file type and encoding checking.
#
# WithPlainInput: false

# WithUniqueNames can be set to true to get a unique list of names.
#
# WithUniqueNames: false

# WithVerification can be set to true if found names need be verified.
# Verification uses a remote service, so it does not work without
# an internet connection.
#
# WithVerification: false

# WithoutBayes determines if both heuristic and Naive Bayes algorithms run
# during the name-finnding.
# false - both heuristic and Naive Bayes algorithms run.
# true - only heuristic algorithms run
