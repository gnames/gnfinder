Preface 



This book wrote itself in response to the many hundreds of inquiries on 
seashells and other mollusks that have been sent to such museums as the 
Smithsonian Institution. Our natural heritage of seashore treasures has always 
been of keen interest to Americans, and in recent years there has been such 
an increase in shell collecting and biological investigations of mollusks that 
the need for a book like this has become apparent. 

American Seashells belongs to the amateurs, for it is their enthusiasm in 
searching beaches and bays and their limitless curiosity into the ways of mol- 
luscan life that have dictated the contents of this book. How do shells grow? 
How do they form their color patterns? How do they breed and what do 
they eat? are the kind of questions asked. But the greatest demand has been 
for a reliable and up-to-date identification work. This need has been felt 
not only by private collectors, but particularly by students of marine biology 
and those undertaking research in fisheries and ecology. In meeting these re- 
quirements, there has been an attempt to strike a balance between the palat- 
able, popular accounts and the more technical material. The illustrations, the 
standardization of popular names and the natural history accounts will be of 
particular interest to the beginner, and it is hoped that the monographic re- 
views, identification keys and the bibliographies will adequately serve the 
serious student. 

There are over 6000 species of mollusks living in North American marine 
waters, and a thorough treatment of them all would call for a book many times 
the size of this. The conchologist will find that the 1500 species discussed or 
illustrated within these pages include every kind of shell likely to be found 
in shallow waters, whether collecting is done in Labrador, Florida or along 
the western shores from Alaska to Lower California. 

While considerable original research went into many parts of this book, 
it should be kept in mind that a popular book covering such a vast fauna is 
merely an expression of the present state of knowledge of our science and 
that time and research by others will inevitably render sections of it obsolete. 

I would like to express my thanks to Dr. Leonard Carmichael, Secretary 
of the Smithsonian Institution, for granting permission to publish on and illus- 
trate specimens housed in the United States National Museum. Although the 
efforts involved in this project did not encroach upon official time, I would 

vii 



viii Preface 

like to record my good fortune in being able to consult the National Museum 
collections on holidays and during after hours. Austin H. Clark stands fore- 
most as spiritual guide and counselor in the many intricacies of preparing a 
book for the public. Dr. Harald A. Rehder, curator of the Division of Mol- 
lusks, with whom I have been pleasantly associated for several years, has kept 
a weather eye on this project and in not a few instances has made valuable 
suggestions. I have gratefully and heavily leaned on the Minutes of the 
Conchological Club of Southern California which represents the work of 
John Q. Burch, A. Myra Keen, A. M. Strong, S. Stillman Berry and many 
others. A4r. Gilbert Voss kindly helped me with the section on squid and 
octopus. This is also true of ]ohvsonia, a magnificent work produced by 
William J. Clench, Joseph Bequaert, Ruth D. Turner and others. I would 
also like to thank my friends in the National Museum for constant encourage- 
ment. 

The heaviest debt is to the countless amateur collectors of American 
mollusks. Were it not for their enthusiastic pursuit of shells and their un- 
selfish desire to share their treasures with our leading museums, our scientific 
collections undoubtedly would be half their present size. It is my sincere 
hope that this book, by its usefulness, will measure up to their kindnesses and 
friendships. 

Illustrations make the book, and American Seashells could not have been 
successfully completed without the aid of Frederick M. Bayer, Associate 
Curator in the National Museum, who is responsible for the colored plates, 
including the lovely paintings of western Atlantic nudibranchs. Most of 
the other photographs were also taken by him. Special thanks are due William 
J. Clench who made available all the photographs and drawings that have 
appeared in Johnsonia. The colored paintings of Pacific coast nudibranchs 
are taken from F. M. MacFarland's "The Opisthobranchiate Mollusks from 
Monterey Bay, California, and Vicinity," which appeared in 1906 in the U. S. 
Bureau of Fisheries Bulletin 25. All of the exquisite pen drawings of shells, 
unless otherwise noted, were executed by the U. S. Army Surgeon, John C. 
McConnell, in connection with researches done by W illiam H, Dall of the 
U. S. Geological Survey. Our photographs of Florida Thorny Oysters are 
from specimens kindly sent on loan by Leo L. Burry of Pompano Beach, 
Florida. 

Notable credit is due Chanticleer Company of New York City which took 
such pains in the preparation of the colored plates, and to the printer who 
retained with such remarkable fidelity the beauty of the original photographs.

Foreword 



Shell collecting is now taking its place as one of the major outdoor 
diversions. It has advantages over such pursuits as bird watching or fishing, 
for you may have even more pleasure in studying your catch at home than 
in the time spent afield. The thrill of finding a shell new to you, or of watch- 
ing some rare snail going about its watery aff^airs, is ample reward for the 
sunburn and stifi" neck you may have from wading around too long with a 
water-glass. Hours sieving dredgings are counted well spent if a fine volute 
or turrid turns up in the seaweed and rubbish. 

American Seashells gives a comprehensive and well-rounded view of the 
Mollusca in nontechnical language. It is easy reading for the beginner, but it 
contains also material indispensable to the advanced malacologist. The chap- 
ters on nudibranchs and pteropods are especially welcome, for these beautiful 
animals have always been slighted in American books. In chapters on the 
life of the snail and the clam, with the author we "listen in" to the current 
of molluscan life. The shells become living things, moving and breathing, 
feeding and mating. 

One perplexity of the novice is that different books may give different 
names for the same shell. The causes of this diversity are explained on a 
later page. With the facilities of the largest museum in America, the author 
has been able to speak with authority in those matters of nomenclature. 
When the problem is zoological and still to be solved by further collections, 
or by the study of living moUusks, then the cooperation of the keen collector 
may give the answer sought. Professional malacologists are few. Their work 
is largely in museums with dead animals. The interesting but long task of 
collecting from a thousand miles of coast, and observing mollusks alive, has 
always been in large part a labor of love by private naturalists. Our science 
owes nearly as much to them as to the work of professional zoologists. 

The author belongs to the younger group of malacologists, but he has 
cultivated the society of mollusks in many lands, from East Africa, the

PART I 



The Natural History 
of Seashells 



CHAPTER I 

Man and Mollusks 



Seashells and man were closely associated even before the dawn of civiliza- 
tion when primitive man gathered snails, oysters, and other kinds of mollusks 
along the seashore for food, implements, ornaments, and money. The many 
kitchen-middens and burial sites in nearly every comer of the world reveal 
the great extent to which early peoples were dependent upon mollusks. On 
some coral islands, as, for instance, Barbados, where there was no available 
stone, nearly all domestic utensils, including knives and axes, were made from 
seashells. As civilization became more complex, specialization in the use of 
mollusks increased. From them were obtained dyes, inks, textiles and win- 
dowpanes. In the Mediterranean region there was a long period when an 
entire commercial empire owed its origin and continued success to the Tyrian 
purple obtained from a seashell. Later, in Roman times, the farming of 
oysters and edible snails became a major enterprise. 

Today the uses of moUuscan shells are legion. Jewelers, artists and but- 
ton manufacturers; biologists, geologists and archaeologists; bird and aquarium 
dealers; all daily use mollusks or their products. In recent years there has 
flourished m Florida a five-million-dollar-a-year seashell industry. Through- 
out the country, the hobby of shell collecting is enjoyed by countless thou- 
sands, and it now rivals the popularity of coin collecting. Local and federal 
agencies arc investing millions in research directed toward the more efficient 
cultivation and utilization of commercially important mollusks. 

From another standpoint of perhaps even greater importance mollusks 
have influenced the activities and welfare of man. Some are extremely de- 
structive to wooden structures in the sea, and others are a serious menace to 
health, mostly as intermediate hosts to dangerous parasites or as carriers of 

3

poisonous micro-organisms. Prior to the advent of ships with metal hulls no 
vessel on the seas was safe from the borings of molluscan "shipworms." 
Many ships have disappeared at sea as a result of being weakened by the 
attacks of these creatures. Even today damage to the extent of millions of 
dollars is done every year to wharf pilings, small craft, and hemp lines by 
these bivalves. In many parts of the world the health of millions is seriously 
menaced by mollusks. It was not until the turn of the century when modern 
research was directed toward tropical diseases that the full importance of 
snails as carriers was appreciated. Six major parasitic diseases have been 
shown to be transmitted by fresh-water mollusks. Thousands of people die 
each year in China and Egypt from the blood-fluke disease alone. No fatal 
snail-borne disease is present in North America proper, but visitors to the 
West Indies and northern South America are warned to keep out of ponds 
and flooded ditches in these regions. 

In other respects, mollusks are of minor medical importance. A number 
of parasitic diseases of sea birds and fish are carried by marine shells, such as 
the periwinkles Littorina and Tectarius and other shore species. During cer- 
tain seasons of the year, usually in late summer, these snail hosts shed thou- 
sands of microscopic larval worms into the sea water. Although normally 
destined to penetrate the skin of birds, these tiny creatures sometimes attack 
man and cause an uncomfortable rash or "swimmer's itch" which is often 
mistaken for jellyfish sting.

Figure i. The large cone shells of the Indo-Pacific, and possibly those of the 
Atlantic, can inflict a serious, and at times fatal, sting. The venom leaves the poison 
sac and, together with the tiny, harpoon-like tooth, is ejected from the snail's pro- 
boscis and stabbed into the skin of the victim. 



Man and Mollusks 5 

Indo-Pacific are the cone shells {Conns), the sting of which is as powerful as 
the bite of a rattlesnake. Although the beautiful cone shells are among the 
commonest of Indo-Pacific mollusks, the total number of authentic cases of 
death from their sting is surprisingly small. No American species have been 
recorded as harmful to man but, because all cones possess the necessary 
apparatus, it would be wise to be careful in handling American specimens 
over two inches in size. 

The number of cone stings is few because of the shy nature of the ani- 
mal. Invariably a snail will withdraw into its shell when disturbed and, unless 
the cone is held quietly in the palm of the hand for some minutes, there is 
little likelihood of the collector being stung. The apparatus for the injection 
of the venom into the skin of the victim is contained in the head of the 
animal. Bite, rather than sting, is perhaps more descriptive of the operation. 
The long, fleshy proboscis or snout is extended from the head and jabbed 
against the skin. Within this tube are a number of hard, hollow stingers, as 
long and slender as needles. These are actually modified radular teeth, com- 
monly used in other snails to rasp their food. Under a high-powered lens the 
teeth of the cone shell resemble miniature harpoons. As the teeth are thrust 
into the skin, a highly toxic venom flows from a large poison gland located 
farther back in the head, out through the mouth, and into the wound through 
the hollow tube of the tooth. In some cases, death has taken place in four to 
five hours after the patient was stung. Not all cases are serious. Andrew 
Garrett, a famous shell collector of the latter half of the nineteenth century, 
reported that he was stung by a tulip cone that caused a "sharp pain not un- 
like the sting of a wasp." 

While in recent years the cone shells have received perhaps an undue 
amount of notoriety as dangerous creatures, they are best known as an aris- 
tocratic family of beautiful shells which have been favorites for years among 
the most discriminating of collectors. For hundreds of years the sound of the 
auctioneer's gavel has been heard at the sale of valuable collections of sea- 
shells, but no shell has created such fevered interest as the Glory-of-the-Seas 
cone. Its present-day value is in the neighborhood of $400 to $600. This 
species seems to possess the ideal combination of features which brings high 
prices — beauty, size, rarity and, above all, mystery or legend. Although the 
legends connected with the Glory-of-the-Seas are for the most part untrue, 
the mere mention of its name will invariably cause the blood pressure of shell 
collectors to rise. 

The first published reference to the Glory-of-the-Seas was in 1757. 
Today the whereabouts of each of the twenty-three specimens is known. 
The most famous finding was made by the renowned shell collector, Hugh 
Cuming, in 1838 when he found three specimens at low tide on the reefs at 
Jacna on Bohol Island in the Philippines. The myth has often been repeated 



6 American Seashells 

that Cuming returned for more only to find that the reef had sunk during an 
earthquake, and that since then no other specimens have been found. How- 
ever, the species is apparently widespread throughout the East Indian region. 
Specimens have turned up since Cuming's day at Cebu in the Philippines, Am- 
boina Island, and Piru Bay in the Dutch East Indies. A four-inch specimen 
was found on the shore at Wahaai, Ceram Island, after a storm in 1896. In 
addition to the existing twenty-three specimens, three were destroyed during 
World War II and eight, formerly known to exist, are missing. A search in 
grandmother's attic or along some East Indian beach will doubtless bring 
others to light. 

Collectors of fancy seashells are constantly in search of specimens of 
outstanding qualities, and although a number of species are well-known for 
their high value or unusual beauty, the standards by which we judge their 
rarity and attractiveness are considerably varied. The differences in our 
appreciation of beauty are natural enough, for the colors, forms and textures 
of seashells are numerous enough to offer appeal to almost any type of aesthetic 
appreciation. The man who covets a brilliantly patterned Olive shell of rich 
golden-red colors may see little in a tiny white shell which another collector 
treasures for its intricate snow-flake sculpturings. 

For many conchologists rarity is gauged by the top price that a specimen 
may bring; for others the important judging point is the scarcity of the spe- 
cies in nature or perhaps the rarity of specimens in collections. Left-handed, 
double-mouthed or distorted specimens, like misprints in stamps, are highly 
valued by many veteran collectors. There are literally hundreds of truly rare 
species, but most of these are deep-sea shells, some of which are known only 
from a single specimen. Most of these are small and not particularly attrac- 
tive. The high-priced shells are found among the showy genera, like the 
cones, Pleurotomaria slit-shells, volutes, murex shells, scallops and cowries. 
The Golden Cowrie is the most popular among the so-called rarities, the 
present-day price ranging from $20 to $60. Some species may be considered 
rarities for years and command very high prices, until they are collected in 
large quantities. The Goliath Conch (Stromhus goliath) is worth about 
$200 today, but collecting in northern Brazil would undoubedly bring them 
to light in great quantities and hence would lower the price to a few dollars. 
The Precious Wentletrap Shell {Epitonium seal are or pretiosum) of the 
western Pacific was in such demand years ago that Chinese found it profit- 
able to make counterfeits out of rice paste. The species is now considered 
reasonably common and is low-priced, but genuine rice counterfeits are now 
rare and equal in value to the price of the first-known shell specimens. 

Some of the most interesting threads of man's early history have been 
woven around the trade routes of primitive peoples and their dispersal of 
shells. The discovery by archaeologists in 1895 of the Red Helmet Shell 



Man and Molhisks 7 

(Cypraecassis rufa) in a grave of the prehistoric Cro-Magnon man in the 
caves of France was of considerable importance in tracing former trade 
routes. This species is found only in the Indian and Pacific oceans. Its pres- 
ence substantiated other archaeological evidence that extensive trade routes 
for great distances existed among early European man. The Tiger Cowrie 
{Cypraea tigris), another Indo-Pacific species, has been found in a prehistoric 
pit-dwelling at St. Mary Bourne at Hants, England, and the Panther Cowrie 
(Cypraea pantherina) , a Red Sea species, has been found in Saxon women's 
graves, excavated in several localities in Kent, England. 

The seashell with perhaps the widest dispersal by the ancients and 
modern man is the small, yellow Money Cowrie {Cypraea moneta) which 
was for many centuries the accepted currency in many parts of the world. 
Although its natural biological distribution is hmited to the vast areas of the 
Indian Ocean, the East Indies and the islands of the tropical Pacific, its use 
as currency or for ornamentation has been almost worldwide. The three 
most unusual records are those located in North America. 

When the aboriginal sites along the Tennessee River were being investi- 
gated at the beginning of this century, five Pacific Money Cowries were un- 
earthed from one of the graves of the Roden Mounds in Alabama. Evidence 
points to the fact that these burials had been made before the mound makers 
had any intercourse with white man. The shells were sent to the United 
States National Museum by their discoverer, and Dr. William H. Dall wrote 
the following interesting reply: — 

I should incline to the belief that the cowries were imported in or 
about the time of Columbus' voyages. Bound, as they supposed, for the 
Indies, where the cowry was formerly (like our wampum) a staple article 
of barter, the exploring vessels would have undoubtedly carried cowries 
as well as other articles of trade we know they carried. It would not have 
taken them long to find out that cowries did not pass as currency with 
American natives, and reporting this on their return to Spain later traders 
would not have carried them for barter. The necklace or bracelet you 
obtained may have passed from hand to hand as a curiosity (as I have 
known such things to do) until it reached a people who knew nothing 
of whites 'till much later. In fact your cowries may have come off one of 
Columbus' own vessels. 

If not from one of Columbus' ships, these shells more than likely were 
brought over from Europe soon afterward by early Spanish explorers. It 
does not seem so plausible to assume, as some ethnologists do, that these shells 
were brought by migrating tribes from eastern Asia to America via the Bering 
Straits lonsr before the time of Columbus. 

The Lewis and Clark Expedition brought back in 1 805 a handsome dress, 
possibly of Cree origin, which was adorned with four dozen Money Cowries. 



8 



American Seashells 



Another Money Cowrie was unearthed near the so-called Onatonabee Ser- 
pent Mound of Peterboro County in Ontario, Canada. It is most hkely that 
in both of these cases the shells were the remnants of the Hudson's Bay Com- 
pany's shell stock which was bartered with the Cree and other Indians well 
before the time of the Lewis and Clark Expedition. 

A hvely trade in marine shells took place for centuries among the pre- 
Columbian peoples of southwestern United States. Archaeological studies in 
that area have been able to confirm the existence of trade routes which then 
existed from three principal geographical areas, one along the coast of south- 
em California, a second from the Gulf of California, and the third on the 
Atlantic side from the coast of the Gulf of Mexico. 




Figure 2. Major sources of trade shells used by the early American Indians. 
a, tusk-shells. Dentalium, used for money; b, abalone shells, Haliotis, and the neck- 
lace shells, Olivella; c, Glycymeris clams for bracelets; d, olive shells, helmet shells, 
Cassis, and many others; e, large whelks, Biisyco?i, and Venus clams; f, wampum 
from the Venus clam, Mercenaria mercenaria. 

Marine shells were used primarily as ornaments. Beads of glossy 
Olivellas and Olive shells were by far the most popular throughout the esti- 
mated 1000-year span of trading. Pendants, bracelets, rattles, trumpets and 
carved shells were popular in that order. Pacific Coast shells were passed on 
from settlement to settlement to a limited extent by the early Basket Makers 
(?-50o A.D.) and, with the rise of the late Basket Makers (500-700 A.D.), 
trading increased from both the Pacific Coast and the Gulf of California. 



Man and Mollusks 9 

It was not until Pueblo times that the Atlantic trade reached the southwest 
when the Pacific trade was also at its zenith. 

For years archaeologists were puzzled by the absence in New Mexico 
of residue shell material which ought to be present wherever bracelets of the 
Gly cymeris clam appear. Not until 1930 were the hundreds of ancient manu- 
facturing centers discovered along the Sonora coast of the Gulf of California. 
There the early Indians sawed out patterns and ground down the clams to a 
smooth finish. The existence of this industry in the areas where the clams live 
illustrates one of the fundamental problems of prehistoric trade where beasts 
of burden were unknown and all goods were carried on men's backs. The 
finished product was not only much lighter, but also brought a better price. 

The Mohaves used a trade route from the Pacific Coast in the vicinity 
of Los Angeles across the mountains into Nevada and Utah, and they perhaps 
have the rightful claim to the title of the "Phoenicians of the West." Several 
routes extended from the Sonora coast of the Gulf of California up to the 
Gila basin to Pecos in northwestern New Mexico. Around this area there is 
evidence that the Pacific and Atlantic trade converged during Pueblo times. 
It is quite likely that Pecos was a trading pueblo between the southwestern 
peoples and the plains tribes. 

In the midwest of the United States an entirely separate trade route ex- 
isted from the Mound Builders of Illinois (Cahokia group) south to the Gulf 
of Mexico. Among the mounds of these prehistoric people the Cameo Hel- 
met Shell {Cassis), the Fighting Conch {Strombus) and the Apple Murex 
Shell have been discovered — all species from southern Florida or the warmer 
waters of the Gulf of Mexico. 

In recent times, the dispersal of mollusks has been little short of spec- 
tacular, particularly so if we may mention in this connection the many large 
collections that have been assembled in natural history museums. For the last 
200 years there has been a steady flow of specimens to these study collections 
from all lands. Probably the largest mollusk collection in existence, that 
housed in the United States National Museum in Washington, contains over 
9,000,000 specimens and represents about 45,000 kinds. This collection is 
the result of a century of labor on the part of thousands of ardent enthu- 
siasts who collectively have stooped to pick up mollusks in over 100,000 
localities throughout the world. 

Added to the scientific traffic of material among dozens of natural his- 
tory institutions, is the constant and spirited exchange of specimens among 
thousands of private shell collectors. It is little short of miraculous that in a 
small Connecticut town one can find in an amateur collection a rare, ivory- 
like Thatcheria shell from 200 fathoms in Japanese waters or a 200-pound 
valve of the giant clam from the Great Barrier Reef of Australia. In a small 
cabinet of land mollusks in Boonton, New Jersey, you may find a giant Afri- 



10 American Seashells 

can snail from the Belgian Congo or a tiny ground snail, no larger than a 
grain of rice, from the Himalaya Mountains of India. The locaHty labels 
attached to many of the shells in museums are milestones in recent history — 
Tobruk, Bizerte, Anzio — Port Moresby, Guadalcanal, Leyte Gulf — Pusan, 
the Han River, and Peking. 

Accidental dispersal of marine shells, even in large quantities, is not un- 
common, and many unusual cases have been recorded in newspapers and 
scientific journals. In the days when the beautiful ear shells or abalones of 
the Cahfornian coast were used extensively for cabinet inlays, a sailing vessel 
bound for New York with a cargo of these shells went down in a storm just 
off Santiago on the south coast of Cuba. For several years, these magnificent 
shells were being cast ashore on the beaches, much to the delight of local 
collectors and small children. 

A similar case occurred in 1873 when the "Glendowra," a four-masted 
vessel, homeward-bound from the Philippine Islands on a cowrie expedition, 
was wrecked off the coast of Cumberland, England. She had on board more 
than 600 bags of Money Cowries destined for use in the African trade and, 
during a heavy fog, ran ashore near Seascale. For years these shells were 
picked up in excellent condition on the nearby beaches. Many collectors, 
unaware of their history, regarded them as native to the British Isles. 

The necessity of taking on ballast to make up for light cargoes on return 
sailing voyages has been responsible for many introductions of exotic shells 
to United States ports. The Money Cowrie has been picked up on one of 
the beaches of Cape Cod and was presumably jettisoned there by a sailing 
ship returning from the Indian Ocean. Ballast Point in San Diego was years 
ago a fairly good place to collect Hawaiian shells and, during World War II, 
a dozen or more species of British marine shells brought in ballast could be 
found in the vicinity of Long Island, New York. 

Wliolesale dispersal of marine shells has been carried out purposely by 
man on several occasions. With malice toward none, it may be said that con- 
siderable competition for the tourist trade exists between the Atlantic and 
Gulf coasts of Florida. Lackinq- the abundance of attractive seashells which 
are now considered prime tourist bait, the Atlantic coasters have made up 
for it by their aggressive ingenuity. It is reported that some Miami hotel 
owners have sent trucks to the rich beaches of the Gulf Coast, loaded them 
with molluscan spoils and brought them back to dump on their o\mi relatively 
shell-less beaches. 

Mollusks have been used extensively in art and literature, and through- 
out history we find numerous uses of shells as symbols. In many parts of the 
world, and especially along our motor highways, the scallop shell is a familiar 
trademark to motorists. The "Shell" Transport and Trading Company had 
its origin in London, England, during the middle of the last century when 



Man and Molhisks 11 

shell ornaments on boxes, screens and frames were popular in Early Vic- 
torian drawing rooms. The founding brothers, Marcus and Samuel Samuel, 
traded in shells from all parts of the globe, but as a side line they began to 
deal in the sale of kerosene. With the advent of the new "parafine oil" lamps 
and, later, the combustion engine, it was not long before they were market- 
ing oil exclusively. Soon afterward their company was merged with the 
Royal Dutch interests. Until 1904 they used a trademark emblem patterned 
after the Sun-rayed Tellin (Tellina radiata of the West Indies), but this was 
later replaced by the now world-famous emblem of the European Jacob's 
Scallop {Fecten jacobaeus) . The scallop on the letterhead of the company's 
stationery is a fossil species from California. 

The 200-odd oil tankers of the Shell Oil Company are named after 
various genera of mollusks, the first ship launched being christened the S. S. 
Murex. Aboard each vessel, a specimen of her namesake mollusk is mounted 
in a glass exhibit case. Naming and securing shells for the first hundred ships 
was comparatively easy, but recently the choice of new names has resulted 
in the unfortunate selection of obscure genera based on rare and, in some 
cases, microscopic species. Some ships bear names based on the same genus 
— nautical synonyms! 

The use of the scallop is a very ancient one. As a source of food and 
as an eating dish it was used in prehistoric times. It is pictured on the coins 
of the early Phoenician outpost of Saguntum (now Murviedro, Spain) . All 
through the middle ages the scallop shell was used as a religious symbol, espe- 
cially in connection with pilgrimages to the shrine of Saint James at Com- 
postella and the crusades to the Holy Land. Three different popes granted 
a faculty to the Archbishops of Compostella to excommunicate all who sold 
scallop shells to pilgrims anywhere except in the city of Compostella. Today 
many of the family shields of England bear scallop shells, indicating that 
their ancestors made pilgrimages to the Holy Land. 

It is interesting to note that one of the earliest shell collections known 
to us contained a Jacob's Scallop. This was unearthed from the ruins of 
Pompeii, together with Comis textile and the Pearl Oyster of the Indian 
Ocean, in what appears to have been a natural history collection. It is not 
beyond the realm of possibility that this was the remains of the Natural His- 
tory Society of Pompeii, of which the distinguished naturalist, Pliny, was 
probably a member. It was Pliny who first recorded the swimming activ- 
ities of the scallop, and he observed that it was able to dart above and skip 
along the surface of the water. 

In our modem age of synthetic dyes and highly mechanized textile 
industries, we little appreciate the part played by dye-producing mollusks 
in the history of the ancient civilizations of the Mediterranean. The power 
and fame of the Phoenicians, who were the great traders, navigators and 



12 America}! Seashells 

colonizers of that region as early as 1500 B.C., were largely due to their 
monopoly of the Tyrian purple dye. The ancient cities of Tyre and Sidon 
(now Souro and Saidi in Lebanon) became great banking centers and the 
crossroads of commerce between Asia, Africa and western Europe. Although 
archaeological findings indicate that purple dye from species of Murex was in 
use in Crete as early as 1600 B.C. and in Egypt by 1400 B.C., these two 
Phoenician cities had managed to monopolize the industry and to expand 
their prosperous enterprises by 1000 B.C. The continual search for new beds 
of Murex is probably one of the reasons for their later colonization of Malta, 
Sicily, Utica, Carthage and Gades (now Cadiz). These ports served as trad- 
ing stations and, as evidenced by the great piles of unearthed Murex shells, 
as subsidiary purple dye factories. The imperial coins of grateful Tyre bore 
for many years the imprint of the Murex shell. It is interesting to note that 
the name Phoenicia comes from the Greek phoenix, "red," which may well 
allude to the red or magenta color variations of the molluscan purple. 

It is now the general consensus that three species of marine snails were 
used in the Mediterranean. Although all three were present in many areas, 
the city of Tyre employed in the main Murex brandaris, while the great 
banks of shells discovered near Sidon in recent times were almost exclusively 
made up of Murex trunculus (see plate 10, figs, i and j). The "buccinum" 
of the Roman naturalists probably was Thais haemastovm. 

The high cost of the purple dye was largely due to the long and arduous 
process of manufacture. A recent experimenter used about 12,000 specimens 
of Murex brajidaris before obtaining 1.5 grams of pure dye, and he estimated 
that one pound of dye in ancient times was worth from $10,000 to $12,000. 

The dye-producing fluid is exuded from an elongate gland which is 
situated on the inner wall of the mantle between the rectum and the gills. 
The fluid is colorless to milky-white when first produced, but when exposed 
to direct sunlight, it changes immediately to bright yellow, then passes 
through shades of pale-green to bluish and finally red-purple. During this 
photochemical process a strong odor is given off which resembles rotting 
garlic. The Tyrians collected vast quantities of living snails and ground up 
the smaller specimens in caldron-shaped holes in the rocky shore. Larger 
specimens were cracked open and the gland-supporting mantle ripped off 
and thrown into the holes. Salt was added to this juicy mass to prevent excess 
rotting, and then the sun was allowed to act on it for two or three days. 
This material was transferred to vessels of tin or lead and then diluted with 
five or six times its bulk in water. A ten-day period of moderate boiling fol- 
lowed, during which time the scum was constantly removed. Test pieces of 
wool were allowed to soak for five hours to ascertain if the desired strength 
of dye had been reached. 

Our modern concept of purple is quite different from that of the 



Man and Mollusks 13 

ancients. They understood it as several colors ranging from dull crimson 
and magenta to violet-purple. The most expensively dyed cloth was made 
in Tyre and was more on the order of a dull red. In Sidon, where Miirex 
trunculiis was mainly used, the color was closer to our modern idea of purple. 
The wide range in hues of Tyrian purple was brought about by different 
strengths of, and varied techniques in making, the dye, including the double- 
dip system of dibapha in which the first bath consisted of extracts from Thais 
and the second dip taking place in Murex dye. The type of cloth and weave 
also produced wide variations. 

There is no question that cloth dyed with Tyrian purple was extremely 
valuable and at times vied in value even with gold. Hence it was reserved 
for the use of the wealthy and the hangings of temples. The Babylonians are 
said to have used it for the dress of their idols. A few of our museums pos- 
sess small pieces of Egyptian mummy wrappings which were dyed with 
Tyrian purple. However, it is necessary to make a chemical analysis to prove 
the presence of this dye, for the ancients were able to produce a similar color 
by double dyeing with indigo and madder. 

The Bible makes several references to this valuable purple. Moses used it 
for the works of the tabernacle, as well as for the clothing of the high priest. 
Among the presents which the Israelites made to Gideon were purple rai- 
ments that belonged to the kings of Midian. Much later, according to Acts 
1 6, verse 14, a seller of purple from Thyatira was converted by St. Paul at 
Phihppi. 

Aristotle and Pliny both gave fairly detailed accounts of the industry 
widespread throughout Asia A4inor. Plutarch records that when Alexander 
took possession of Susa he found among the treasures of Darius 5000 talents 
in weight (290,000 pounds) of purple cloth. Athenaeus states that the dye 
was extensively used as a cosmetic and was applied as a lipstick and rouge 
in Rome. At the fateful battle of Actium, the ship of Marcus Antonius and 
Cleopatra was distinguished from the rest of the fleet by having sails solidly 
dyed in Tyrian purple. It is difficult to believe, as many authorities claim, 
that the Tyrians kept the process a secret even for a short time, for we find 
that factories existed throughout most areas in the Mediterranean. 

In Rome only senators were allowed to wear a broad purple stripe (latus 
clavus) around the opening of the tunic. Laws were finally introduced by 
Nero and again by Theodosius (379-395 A.D.) prohibiting the wearing of 
Tyrian purple except by the Emperor himself. Except for its later use by 
the Christian church, especially in cardinal cloaks, the crimson color ceased 
to be worn or manufactured after the fall of the Roman Empire and the con- 
quest of Tyre by the Arabs in 638 A.D. It would scarcely pay to revive the 
industry except perhaps as a novelty item for tourists. The color is not par- 
ticularly exciting to the modern eye, and, in addition, it may be synthetically 



14 American Se ash ells 

produced at low cost, so that one has no assurance that a souvenir textile is 
actually dyed with molluscan purple. 

The Mediterranean area and the west coast of Africa were not the only 
regions where mollusks were used for dyeing. In the British Isles the art 
seems to have been known from very early times. The Celts of England and 
the Lake Dwellers of Ireland (about looo B.C.) used the common Thais 
Japilhis which is also abundant on New^ England shores. As late as the eight- 
eenth century this species was used for marking linen in England, Scotland, 
France and Norway. The French used molluscan purple to dye the parch- 
ment of rare books, some examples of which are still bright after 800 years. 

Had the Phoenicians possessed the compass and ventured to the West 
Indies, they would have marveled at the abundance of our Wide-mouthed 
Purpura, Fiirpura patuJa, and its large production of rich violet dye. Collec- 
tors who have put live specimens in a cloth bag will recall the bright, durable 
stains that have appeared soon afterward in the fabric. Many shell collections 
contain this species in which specimens still retain purple stains on the out- 
side of the shell. The subspecies, pansa, was used in prehistoric times for 
dyeing cotton on the northwest coast of South America and the west coast 
of Central America. Even today the Tehuantepec Indians of Mexico use the 
Pansa Purpura for dyeing cotton threads. The natives have put into effect a 
plan of conservation and, instead of crushing the shells, they carefully "milk" 
the living specimens by pressing in the animal to squeeze out the juice. They 
then return the mollusks to the rocks and revisit them at a later date. The 
cotton threads are individually drawn through the liquid to obtain the fast 
dye. 

In 1 7 1 1 Reaumur accidentally discovered that the t^g capsules of Thais 
lapilhts were a simpler and more abundant source for the purple dye. As 
Miirex egg capsules mature, they take on a characteristic purplish hue. It is 
possible that this was the secret, if such existed, that the Tyrians guarded so 
jealously. Latest experiments indicate that the purple dye is a derivative of 
indigo containing bromide. 

Probably most, if not all, species of Murex, Thais, P^irpiira and other 
members of the Muricid family produce this bromide, dye-giving secretion. 
It has been suggested by some workers that this secretion serves as an anes- 
thetic on various oysters, clams and chitons upon \\'hich they prey. How- 
ever, the presence of purpurase in the Qgg capsules does not favor this view. 
In addition, the dye-producing gland is closely associated with the reproduc- 
tive system and not with the salivary glands or any other organs of the 
proboscis. Many other carnivorous families which attack other living mol- 
lusks in a manner similar to that of the A4uricids do not produce this dve. 

Inks and dyes are produced by many other mollusks, the Sepia cuttlefish 
being an outstanding example. Purple dye has been recorded in the Purple 



Ma7J and Mollusks 15 

Sea Snails, ]anthina, in the Wentletraps, Epitonium, in some of the Mitras 
and Olive shells and in the sea hares, Aplysia. These substances are known 
to be irritating to fish and other would-be predators, and its purpose as a 
defense mechanism seems most likely. Probably future experiments will show 
that the egg capsules of Mjirex, loaded as they are with purpurase, are dis- 
tasteful to fish and have an unusually high survival value. 



CHAPTER II 

Life of the Snails 



The private lives of the snails, or gastropods as they are more correctly 
called, are almost as varied as the different kinds of seashells that are found 
along our beaches. More than half of the 80,000 species of existing snails live 
under marine conditions, the remainder being air-breathing land species or 
inhabitants of fresh water. In their evolutionary struggle for existence, they 
have shown an amazing diversity in adapting themselves to nearly every con- 
dition found in the sea. There are snails that creep, jump, swim, burrow, 
some that are permanently anchored to rocks and a few that live inside other 
marine creatures. In a few cases, as in some conchs and top shells (Troclms), 
the snail may play host to small fish and tiny crabs. 

Gastropods have experimented in all manner of forms, colors and sizes. 
In size they vary from the two-foot-long Horse Conch of Florida {Pleuro- 
ploca gigantea) to the microscopic Vitrinellas that scarcely exceed the size 
of a grain of sugar. Some species display unusual ornamentation and, as in 
the Murex shells, produce long, delicate spines. There are few objects in 
nature that can vie in beauty with the glistening sheen found in the shells of 
the ohves and cowries. On the other hand, the beautiful sea slugs or nudi- 
branchs may entirely lack a shell. The Carrier Shell, Xenophora, has ac- 
quired the strange habit of collecting shells, bits of coral and other hard 
objects, and cementing them to its own shell. 

WHERE THEY LIVE 

From the high levels of the coastal cliffs to the canyons of the ocean's 
bottom, a thousand kinds of habitats have been adopted by marine gastro- 

16

pods. A few species of nerites and periwinkles are known to ascend trees 
near the seashore, although tree-dwelling is best known among certain tropi- 
cal land snails. In the tropics, the Tectarius prickly-winkles habitually live 
in or near splash pools along the rocky coast where spray from the waves and 
drenching rains are constantly changing the temperature and salinity. When 
the pools are dry the snails are often able to withstand weeks of hot sun 
and parched conditions. 

Three kinds of snails in American waters are forever destined to wander 
at large on the surface of the open ocean. The purple Janthina snails are 
born, live and, in most instances, die at sea. These pelagic snails live upside 
down and remain at the surface by means of a small raft of bubbles. Small 
bubbles of air are entrapped in a special mucus secreted by the animal. This 
clear fluid congeals upon contact with salt water and air, and it adheres to 
the foot. The entire float has much the appearance of crumpled cellophane. 
The female attaches her small eggs to the underside of the float where they 
are partially shaded from the sun's rays. The Janthinas live off the coasts of 
our southern states, and during certain seasons they are commonly cast ashore 
in California, Florida and the Gulf States. Specimens have been blown off 
their Gulf Stream course and been washed ashore in New England and even 
the British Isles. 

As is the case with so many other pelagic creatures, the shell surface of 
Janthina which faces downward (the spire of this upside down shell) is 
colored a light, milky blue. This is probably a protective coloration which 
blends with that of the surface of the sea, which to an underwater observer 
is similarly colored. For some unknown reason Janthinas are completely 
blind. 

Two other groups of gastropods live at the surface of the ocean and, 
like Jantlmia, live an upside down existence. These are the tiny brown 
Litiopa snails which adhere to floating sargassum seaweed by means of a 
silken thread of mucus, and the heteropods or fin-footed sea snails which 
remain afloat by paddling a wide, fin-shaped foot. The latter group includes 
the rare and highly prized Carinaria, the Atlanta shells and the shell-less 
Firoloida. 

Not all pelagic mollusks live solely at the surface. The transparent, 
delicate-shelled sea butterflies or pteropods (pronounced tero-pods) remain 
several fathoms below the surface during the daylight hours but move up- 
ward toward the surface at night. In many equatorial areas pteropods exist 
in great numbers, and the steady rain of the sinking shells of the dead mol- 
lusks litter the ocean's bottom many feet deep. Among the sea slugs, one 
species of nudibranch (Scyllaea) is always pelagic, while the small and beau- 
tiful Bat Sea Slug, Gastropteron rubrum, makes nocturnal trips from the 
bottom of the shallow bay to the surface. The two pancake-shaped lobes of

the foot of this snail are flapped up and down much in the manner of a bat 
in flight. 

However, the pelagic habitat and the ability to swim are the exception 
among the snails. The intertidal zone which is intermittently flooded and 
drained by the moving tides is well stocked with many kinds of creeping 
snails. Adany Nassarius Mud Snails live exclusively on the warm, flat mud-

bars of quiet bays. Among the carnivorous snails, we find that their ecologic 
stations are determined by the location of the worms or bivalves upon which 
they feed. One or two species of Terebra and Polinices Moon Shell are found 
burrowing in the sand of beach slopes where they are able to find their favor- 
ite clams, but the majority of these snail genera are found from low-tide mark 
to a depth of several fathoms. Since most marine gastropods are nocturnal in 
habit and shun bright sunlight, many species spend their time hidden in crev- 
ices under rocks. This affords protection to themselves and their eggs from 
predators, bright sun and violent wave action. 

A great number of species live in deep water, and frequently their verti- 
cal distribution is limited to relatively narrow ranges. From some 500 dredg- 
ing samples taken off southeastern Florida by the late J. B. Henderson's yacht 
"Eolis," Bayer's Dwarf Olive (Olivella bayeri) was found in depths ranging 
from 25 to 115 fathoms. On the other hand, the Greenland Moon Shell has 
been found from twelve feet to over two miles in depth. 

In their experimental search for new living places, a few gastropods have 
evolved strange associations with other marine animals. Tlie dwarf Cypho-

ma {Smtnia) lives on the latticed blades of seafans, while the root-like bases 
of the same seafans may be honeycombed with pockets of the Coralliopbila 
shells. Some species of Trivia cowries not only live with the compound as- 
cidians or sea squirts (Botryllus) but also feed upon them. Deep holes are 
eaten into the ascidian in which the female snail deposits her flask-shaped egg 
capsules (fig. 9). Among the Eulima and tiny Pyram snails there are many 
species which parasitize sea urchins and certain kinds of clams. Several spe- 
cies of Sty lifer live embedded in the flesh of starfish, and only a wart-like

swelling and a bit of shell spire projecting above the surface reveal their pres- 
ence. One species of Eulima lives inside the intestinal tract of the sea cucum- 
ber and obtains its food by tapping the nutritious juices of its host by means 
of a modified, syringe-like snout. 



HOW THEY GROW 

In most cases the shell material in the snails is secreted by special glands 
located along the edge of the fleshy mantle of the animal. Within the aper- 
ture or mouth of the shell a certain amount of reinforcing material may be 
secreted by the roof of the mantle, especially in the case of the heavy trochid 
shells which are nacreous within the aperture. The foot is often the source 
of shell material, not only as the site of the formation of the hard trapdoors 
or opercula of the turban and natica shells but also as an important addition 
to the shell itself. The actual formation of calcium carbonate and the forma- 
tion of the various layers are discussed in more detail in the chapter on clams. 

In some groups of gastropods, particularly certain wentletraps and liotias, 
the mantle edge is capable of producing exquisitely fine filigree or porous 
shell structure whose intricate designs and overlapping layers can best be 
seen with the aid of a magnifying glass. In the cowrie shells, the mantle has 
two large extensions which are spread at will over the entire outside of the 



20 



A77ierjca?i Seas he Us 



shell. This covering mantle continually adds thin paintings of shell material 
over the entire outer surface of the adult shell. In these groups, where the 
outside of the shell is protected by the mantle, there is no production of pro- 
tective, horny periostracum. This is a tough, mat-like and often hairy cover- 
ing to the shell which prevents acids and marine growths from doing damage.

how the spire gradually disappears and the marginal slit becomes an apical hole.

In contrast to the bivalves, many gastropods exhibit certain modified 
shell structures when they become reproductively mature. In many instances 
adulthood of an individual is accompanied by the formation of a thickened 
or flaring apertural lip. It is most pronounced in the Strombus conchs. Peli- 
can's Foot (Aporrhais) , marginellas, cowries and others. Such development 
is unknown in the cone shells, Busycon whelks, abalones and a host of others. 

Growth of the gastropod shell is more rapid in young individuals. Some 
species apparently continue to grow in size during their entire life span, while 
others cease once sexual maturity is reached. In the murex shells and frog 
shells (Cymatium) and certain Cassis helmet shells a strong varix or thick- 
ened rib may be formed at the edge of the shell lip at regular intervals regard- 
less of sexual or seasonal conditions. Each thick varix represents a resting 
period in growth. Collectors may have noticed that they seldom find murex 
shells in a growth stage between varices. This is because over ninety percent 
of the snail's life is spent in the varix stage and because additional growth 
between varices takes place in less than two days. 

The color pattern of shells is a graphic representation in time of the 
secretory activity of the pigment-producing cells located along the mantle 
edge. The ground color is produced by the whole line of cells; banding is 
produced by the special activity of groups of cells, often sharply localized. 
Where the activity of these groups is cyclical, blotching results; where the 
active focus moves up and down the mantle edge, or where activity spreads 
from a focus, there may be formed zigzag, V-shaped or circle patterns. A 



Life of the Snails 21 

review of the biochemistry of shell pigments has been made by Alex Com- 
fort (195 1 ). 

Rate of growth and span of life in gastropods vary according to the 
species and ecologic conditions. The maximum age of marine species is very 
imperfectly known. Undoubtedly many species live for only two, three or 
four years. The common European periwinkle {Littorina littorea) found in 
New England has been kept alive in captivity for twenty years. Large speci- 
mens of the Horse Conch, the Queen Conch (Strojnbus gigas) and the 
Cameo King Conch (Cassis) probably represent ten to twenty-five years of 
growth. The nudibranch sea slugs are believed to be short-lived, and Aeolis 
and Goniodoris have been shown to survive only into the second year. It is 
quite likely, though, that the Aplysia seahares and the Bulla Bubble Shells 
live for at least five years. 

The ultimate size of individuals in species in which the sexes are sepa- 
rate may be influenced by the sex of the individual. In many groups, such 
as the buccinid and Busycon Whelks, the Strombus conchs, periwinkles and 
others, the shells of the females are always considerably larger. In the Pale 
Lacuna Periwinkle (Lacuna pallidula), the females are from five to ten times 
as large as the males. 

Considerable variation in size results from the diet of mollusks. It has 
been experimentally shown that the Ovster Drill snails (Urosalpinx cinerea) 
eating My a clam and oyster meat show the greatest increase in growth, while 
those feeding on barnacles and Mytilus mussels show the least amount of 
growth. It has also been found that snails of this species living in brackish 
water grow to a larger size than those living in pure sea water. Colonies of 
snails exhibiting these ecologic characters have been erroneously considered 
new species by some workers. 

HOW THEY FEED 

The gastropods are much more imaginative in their selection and man- 
ner of acquiring food than the bivalves and other mollusks. Unlike the 
clams, most snails travel in search of their food. A great proportion of the 
marine gastropods are carnivorous, but some are detritus feeders, others are 
vegetarians, and a few, like their bivalve relatives, are suspension feeders. 

Among the flesh-eating snails, there have been many modifications in 
the structure of the mouth parts, including the proboscis and the teeth. In 
some the snout has remained very simple, and the snail merely pushes the end 
of its mouth against its food and tears off bits with the tongue-like radula or 
row of teeth. But in others a remarkably long, tube-like extension is devel- 
oped which, when not in use, is retracted within the snout or head of the 
snail. When a living Melongena Crown Conch is quickly picked up, one can 



22 American Seashells 

frequently see the three-inch-long, tubular proboscis being withdrawn into 
the snail's head. This indicates that a clam or worm, upon which the snail 
was feeding, is located at that spot one or two inches below the surface of 
the mud. 



Figure 6. The open mouth of the Moon Snail, Natica, showing the radula ribbon 
and its teeth. X3. (Redrawn from Ankel 1936.) 

In the Natica Moon Shells, there is a muscular disk on the under surface 
near the end of this extensible proboscis, which serves as a suction disk while 
the radula is at work on the clam shell. No evidence of the presence of acid 
has been presented so far. Once the clam is perforated, the long proboscis is 
wiggled down into the flesh of the clam and the moon shell is able to remove 
most of the flesh without opening up the valves of the clam. Some Murex 
Snails and the Busy con Whelks open their clam victims by applying suction 
with the sole of the foot and by prying apart the valves with the edge of the 
outer lip of the shell. 

The large group of rachiglossate snails (those having three large teeth 
in each radular row) are for the most part predators. The Tun Shells and 
Cassis Helmet Shells feed upon live sea urchins. The Xancus Chanks, Busy con 
Whelks and others feed upon live clams. The Nassa Mud Snails, however, 
are purely scavengers, and their ability to detect the odor or taste of spoiled 
meat in the water is highly developed. Among the toxoglossate snails (those 
with tiny, needle-like, harpoon-shaped teeth as shown in figure i), the cones 
and Terehra shells have a highly developed poison gland and duct which are 
presumably used in quieting their prey. 

Vegetarians are found among the more primitive gastropods. All of the 
Hmpets, nerites, trochids and turban snails graze on seaweeds. However, many 
of the "middle-class" snails, among them the ceriths, Modulus, and some 
periwinkles, limit their feeding to swallowing mud detritus on the bottom 



Life of the Snails 23 

from which they obtain small algal cells and diatoms. The common Atlantic 
Shpper Shell feeds in the same manner as the oyster, and its stomach is found 
to contain the same diatomaceous food. Just as in the oyster, a food current 
of water is set up in the mantle cavity and the pectinate gill acts as a food 
sieve. The food particles are entrapped on the gills by a mucus secreted by 
an endostyle which is located at the base of the gill. Tiny cilia move the 
food along a groove on the side of the body to a pouch located near the 
mouth where it is then taken in up through the proboscis. Turritella com- 
rminis of Europe buries itself in mud and has a ciliary feeding habit. This 
snail remains for days in one spot just below the surface of the mud. An 
inhalant depression in the mud is made by lateral movements of the foot, and 
the action of thousands of cilia creates a current which brings food-laden 
water into the mantle cavity. There is a unique exhalant siphon constituted 
by two overlapping folds, and through this are expelled water and fecal 
pellets without disturbing the surrounding mud. 

The most extreme modifications in the entire molluscan phylum have 
occurred in connection with the feeding habits of certain parasitic snails. For 
years the Entoconcha snails found inside the Synapta sea cucumbers were 
thought to be some form of parasitic worm. The "head" of the mollusk is 
attached in leech-like fashion to a blood vessel of the host, and its worm-like 
body is embedded in the gonads of the sea cucumber. The adult parasite has 
no shell, sensory organs, nervous system or radula. It is little more than a 
tube adapted to absorbing the blood of the host and carrying on self-fertili- 
zation. Were it not for the tiny young found inside the adult with their 
small shell and operculum, it is doubtful if these creatures would ever have 
been thought to be mollusks. 

The passage of food from the buccal cavity, through the esophagus to 
the stomach is facilitated by muscular contractions of the wall of the alimen- 
tary tract and by saliva produced by the two salivary glands. The hind end 
of the esophagus may be modified into a gizzard, and in many Bubble Shells, 
especially Scaphander, there are several large, cucumber-shaped plates armed 
with hard corrugations which grind the food into small particles. The stom- 
ach proper consists of a simple enlargement of the digestive canal. Its wall 
may be smooth, furrowed, or lined with spines. As in most bivalves, some 
snails possess a jelly-like crystalline style which projects into one corner of 
the stomach and dissolves off digestive enzymes. The so-called "liver" of the 
snail which forms most of the upper part of the soft, coiled viscera is actually 
a digestive gland where food material is broken down and absorbed into the 
blood stream.

HOW THEY BREATHE 

Breathing by most aquatic marine snails takes place through the gills 
where oxygen is obtained from the sea water and where the waste gases are 
dissolved. The numerous gill leaflets are usually located on the inner side 
of the mantle. Except in the primitive snails with a pair of gills, water is 
brought into the mantle cavity through the siphonal canal or through the 
region to the left of the head. It then bathes the gills and passes out on the 
right side of the body. The current of water is maintained by thousands of 
microscopic, lashing, hair-like cilia mostly on the gill leaflets. 

Like the bivalves, the snails display a wide variety of types of gills. The 
most primitive groups, such as some of the Keyhole Limpets, Slit-shells, 
Pleurotomarias and abalones have two pairs of gills. They are of equal size 
in the Keyhole Limpets, but in some others the right one is considerably 
smaller. In the higher groups of snails, the left gill is the only one remaining. 
In the Cerithidea snails, the gills are reduced to mere stumps, and respiration 
takes place in the mantle skin itself. The sea slugs have lost their ctenidia 
but have evolved very complicated and beautiful gill-like organs on the sides 
and back of their bodies. Many of these gills have taken on the shape of 
miniature shrubs and trees. 

HOW THEY REPRODUCE 

The subject of reproduction among the gastropods is a fascinating study 
of many important phases of biology. Our final concepts of the formation of 
species, our understanding of zoogeography, distributional methods and the 
basis of sex determination are dependent on a fuller knowledge of reproduc- 
tion. The manner of assuring fertilization of eggs, the various methods of 
egg-laying and brooding of young and the interesting types of larval devel- 
opment are horizons of research that are now being expanded. 

The gastropods exhibit nearly every possible modification of sexuality. 
Two of the three orders of snails, the opisthobranchs containing the sea slugs 
and the land snail pulmonates, combine a complete set of male and female 
organs in the same individual. The gonad produces both sperm and eggs, 
but there are separate ducts for the products of each sex. Despite the dual 
sex life, all mature individuals experience the mating instincts of both sexes, 
and during copulation there is a mutual exchange of sperm. In some sea 
slugs, the tectibranchs, several individuals may form rows or a ring of copu- 
lating snails. In some fresh-water pulmonates, self-fertilization is sometimes 
practiced, and some experimenters liave bred over ninety generations, extend- 
ing over twenty years, without cross-fertilization between individuals. 

The marine gastropods contain representatives of several categories of 



Life of the Snails 25 

sexuality. Dual sexuality or hermaphroditism as found in the pulmonates is 
also known in some species of Acmaea Limpets, Janthina, Odosto7nia, Stilifer, 
Valvata and the Paper Moon Snail, Velutina. The sexuality of this type, 
however, is more of the consecutive type, in which the gonads at first pro- 
duce sperm and later in the season only eggs. 

Sex reversal is especially characteristic of the Slipper Shell family. The 
best known examples belong to the Cup-and-saucer Shells, Calyptraea and 
Crucibulum, and the true Slipper Shells, Crepidula. Individuals function as

the male sex when young and as females when fully grown. The change-over 
may be gradual with the individual being ambisexual for a short period, or 
the male phase may suddenly disappear with the loss of its associated organs, 
and the female organs may then quickly develop. The males are much 
smaller than the females. In most species, each young male tends to creep 
about until it finds an individual of the same species in the female phase, 
whereupon it attaches itself to the dorsal side of the female's shell in a posi- 
tion adjacent to the female copulatory organs (fig. yi). In other species the

males usually occupy positions in the vicinity of the female and move to the 
mating position at night. Occasionally bachelors are found which either by 
chance or choice remain solitary throughout the entire male phase. 

Soon after hatching from the tgg, and in one species (Crepidula adunca 
Sowerby from Panama) even before hatching, a slender copulatory organ, 
the verge or phallus, grows out from the body behind the right tentacle (fig. 
7), As the female phase develops later in life, the verge begins to shrink and 
is finally absorbed as the female organs take form. Associated with these 
changes is a marked alteration in behavior, whereby the wandering individ- 
ual, which was so characteristically masculine when young, now becomes 
strictly sedentary. She receives her mate, lays her eggs in capsules beneath 
her foot and broods her young until they are prepared for their own inde- 
pendence. 

In our Common Slipper Shell, Crepidula fornicata, those individuals 
which live on muddy bottoms where there are no solid objects to which 
they can attach themselves, frequently pile up in groups of six to twelve or 
more. These groups continue from year to year, newly arrived young in the 
male phase attaching themselves to the top of the pile as the old, female- 
phase individuals die at the bottom. 

Most marine prosobranchs, however, are of separate sexes (dioecious or 
unisexual). While some species in which the sex products of both sexes are 
discharged freely into the water have no outward morphological features, 
there are a great number of gastropods in which the male has an external 
copulatory organ or verge. The shape and position of the verge are often 
used in classifying families, genera or species. 

Depending upon the species, and sometimes the genus, the females take 
care of their young in a variety of ways. In some there is no motherly 
instinct, and the eggs are liberated directly into the water where they float 
away on the chance of being fertilized by the free-swimming sperm from a 
nearby male. (See fig. 9 with Tectarms and Littorina.) In other types the 
eggs are fertilized and undergo development to the adult-like form in the 
uterine portion of the oviduct. Others have developed a kangeroo-like pouch 
in the tissues of their back where the young are allowed to develop to the 
adult form. Once liberated, however, the young do not return to the pouch. 
Viviparity or the giving birth to young alive (technically ovoviviparity) is 
known in Planaxis, Littorina saxatilis and a number of fresh-water species in 
several different families. 



The Egg Cases of Snails 

Among a large proportion of the marine gastropods, the females form 
special egg cases or capsules into which the eggs are placed, and where the 



Life of the Snails 29 

eggs may develop in an undisturbed, food-laden medium. Very frequently 
extra eggs (nurse eggs) are added which serve as food for the young that 
hatch first. The young may emerge from the egg cases as miniature replicas 
of their parents and commence a life of crawling and feeding, or they may 
escape as free-swimming larval forms. The latter are known as veligers and 
possess special organs for swimming. The larval shell is often quite different 
from the adult shell and, in some species, there may be an extra shell or 
echinospira encasing the entire veliger. 

There are many types of tgg cases, and some of these are illustrated in 
figures 8 and 9; others are briefly described under the generic or family 
discussions in the identification section. Several types of egg-laying may be 
found within a single family or even genus. 

1. Eggs Laid in Capsules and Attached to the Bottom: 

Rissoidae, Caecum, Epitomum, Thais, Miirex, Coins, Neptunea, Busy- 
con, Buccinum, MeloTigena, Nassarius, Bela, Mangelia, Voluta, Conus, Co- 
lumbella, Fusinus, Cancellaria, Marginella, Neritidae and others. Of these, 
some have nonpelagic development: some Murex, Cojjus, Natica and most 
Marginella; others have pelagic, free-swimming young: Nerita, some 
Murex, some Conus and some Natica. 

2. Eggs Laid in Gelatinous Masses or Strings: 

Acmaea, Gibbula, Fissurella, Lacuna, Littorijia obtusata, some Turri- 
tella, Bittium, Triphora, Cerithium, Capulus, Strombus, Aporrhais, Cassis, 
all opisthobranchs and heteropods. 

3. Eggs Laid in Capsules and Protected by the Female: 

Crepidula, Calyptraea, Janthina, Cypraea, Hipponix, Vermetus. 

4. Eggs Laid in Sandy Collars: 

Folinices and Natica. 

5. Eggs Shed and Developing Suspended in Water: 

Some Acn/aea, some Gibbida, Tectarius, some Littorina, Haliotis, and 
the heteropods, Atlanta and Oxy gyrus. 

In some groups of snails which are more or less sedentary, the tgg cap- 
sules may be protected by the female. In the cap-shell, Hippojiix, the under- 
side of the foot of the female has a tough, reinforced ridge of flesh to which 
she attaches her gelatinous tgg sacs. In some worm-shells, Verv^etus, whose 
shells are permanently attached to the rocks, the eggs are deposited on the 
inside of the female's own shell. 

The time and length of breeding differs among mollusks depending 
mainly on the geographical locality, the temperature of the water, phases of 
the moon and the inherent characteristics of the species. Some species spawn 
once a year for a few weeks only, while others may produce eggs half of 
the year as long as the temperature is suitable. 

The eggs, larvae and young have been described for many species by 



30 American Seashells 

famous workers such as Gunnar Thorson, Marie Lebour and others. The 
common European Periwinkle {Littorina Httorea) will serve here as an ideal 
example of the pelagic type of development. The female spawns two to 
twelve hours after copulation by the male. About 200 single q^^ capsules 
are shed during the night. During the entire breeding season of six months, 
the total number of tgg capsules per female is estimated at about 5000, and 
a half dozen copulations are necessary to ensure fertilization of all the eggs. 
The helmet-shaped capsules are shed freely and float about in the water. 
Each contains from one to nine eggs. The free-swimming young, called 
veligers, hatch on the sixth day and remain afloat for two weeks or more, 
depending upon temperature conditions, then sink to the bottom and begin 
an adult snail's life of crawling. They reach maturity on the second or third 
year and may live for five to ten years. 

In contrast to this mode of spawning, the Left-handed Whelk of Florida 
{Busycon contrarhmi) lays its horny strings of t'g^g capsules during a rela- 
tively short period of a few weeks. On the west coast of Florida egg-laying 
usually takes place in the spring. The female digs down well below the 
surface of the sand and attaches the first few capsules to a buried rock or 
broken shell. As the process of extrusion of the t^g capsules continues, the 
female moves toward the surface until its siphon can protrude into the water 
to allow easy respiration. As more capsules are made, the string may loop 
out into the water above the hidden adult. From five to fifteen cases may 
be formed each day, and a completed two-foot-long string may have nearly 
a hundred capsules. Within each case there may be two to twenty-five eggs 
which in a few weeks will develop to quarter-inch-long young. These minia- 
ture replicas of the adults eat their way out of the case at a special "door" 
and commence crawling and feeding immediately. The Left-handed Whelk 
begins spawning at a relatively early age, commonly when no larger than 
three inches. In such cases the capsules are only a half inch in diameter, 
while larger females may produce capsules about the size of a half dollar. 



CHAPTER III 

Life of the Clams 



Of the approximate 15,000 species of existing clams or bivalves, four fifths 
live in the sea, while the remainder are inhabitants of fresh-water rivers, lakes 
and ponds. Throughout the seventy or so famihes of this class, the clams 
show an amazing diversity of ways of adapting themselves to almost every 
kind of aquatic environment. There are clams that swim, burrow, dangle by 
silken threads, others that are permanently cemented to rocks and corals, 
some that live a sedentary life of attachment to other marine creatures. In 
size, they vary from the 500-pound giant Tridacna clams of the East Indies, 
which reach a length of over four feet, to the pinhead-sized Amethyst Gem 
Shells {Gemma), which so heavily populate some of our intertidal flats. In 
ornamentation and coloration the clams are almost unexcelled in their wide 
range of beautiful hues and bizarre shapes. 

WHERE THEY LIVE 

The bivalves have selected a wide variety of ecological stations in life. 
While many must live in strictly marine waters, a few have adapted them- 
selves to the brackish waters and estuaries and inland bays. One species, the 
'Coon Oyster of Florida and the West Indies, has "taken to the trees" and 
is able to withstand exposure to the air for several hours, or even days, 
between high tides. In its early, free-swimming stages, the oyster is carried 
by the rising tide in among the roots, trunks and overhanging boughs of the 
mangrove trees where it settles and attaches itself. Feeding, growth and 
reproductive activities take place only during the few short hours of high 

31 



32 American Seashells 

tide. The Coquina Clam, Donax, is faced with much the same problem of 
making the most of high tides but, in contrast to the sedentary hfe of its 
oyster cousin, it leads a very active existence on the sandy beaches along the 
open ocean. It is an attractive sight when a scouring wave suddenly studs 
the white beach with dozens of brightly hued clams. The tumbling motion 
and sudden exposure to light act as a stimulus to the clam which instantly 
thrusts out its small muscular foot and rapidly pulls itself down into the 
sand again. During the three or four hours in which the waves are sweeping 
the middle and upper sections of the beach, the tiny clams may be uncovered 
and obliged to burrow down again several hundred times. 

While many clams prefer clean sand as a habitat, others are habitual 
mud-dwellers. The handsome Angel Wing, Barnea costata, is usually found 
in mud so soft and deep that Florida collectors find it extremely difficult to 
reach them. The Angel Wing is usually located one or two feet below the 
mud surface and maintains its connection with the bay's waters with its long 
siphon. Because of its popularity as a souvenir and collector's item, methods 
have been devised to collect them at high tide from a boat or barge. Power- 
ful jets of water are forced through hoses, the mud is swept away from the 
clams, and then hand-nets are employed to gather them. In more shallow 
regions where a mixture of sand in the bay bottom permits walking, the 
exposed Angel Wings are gathered by hand at the next low tide. 

The majority of marine clams live in a substrate of sandy mud, but a 
few have become specialized to the extent of making burrows in exceedingly 
compact clay, as in the case of the Arctic Saxicave, Hiatella arctica, and 
the False Angel Wing, Petricola. A few groups such as the Date Mussels, 
Lithophaga, and the Piddocks, Pholas, burrow into corals, other shells or 
soft rocks such as sandstone and limestone. The shipworms, Teredo and 
Bankia, are expert at drilling out their long, tube-like homes in wooden 
planks of ships, wharf pilings, and manila hemp. So too is the Wood Piddock 
or Martesia. 

A large proportion of bivalves are found in shallow water, but many 
others are typically deep-water dwellers. The bathymetric range for some 
species may be narrowly defined in the case of certain scallops. Dipper 
Clams {Cuspidaria) and astartes. On the other hand, some species found in 
a few feet of water may also occur in depths of over two miles. One species 
of Abra Clam, Abra projundorum E. A. Smith, has been dredged in the 
mid-North Pacific at a depth of 2,900 fathoms — over three miles! 

HOW THEY GROW 

The shelly valves of clams are the product of the fleshy mantle. This 
thin, leaf-like organ covers the animal as the flyleaves cover the body of a 



Life of the Clams 3 3 

book and, by its physiological activities, secretes the hard valves of calcium 
carbonate, which thus come to occupy the position of the covers of the 
book. In the simplest form of mantle the edges are free except on the back, 
where the hinge of the shell is located, corresponding to the arrangement of a 
book. Sea water may enter the cavity enclosed by the mantle at almost any 
place. In many groups of bivalves, however, the mantle edges may be fused, 
not only along the back where the valves are joined together but along all 
or most of the lower margins. Openings are usually present to accommodate 
the foot and siphons when such organs are developed. 




Figure io. Structure and layers of a clam shell {Tellma tenuis), a, Diagrammatic 

representation of a small piece of shell; b, Cross-section of shell showing the loose 

end of periostracum around the margin of the shell. (After Trueman 1942.) 



From its food supply the clam absorbs minerals into its blood system 
which are then carried to the mantle. A certain amount of shell deposition 
takes place along the thickened borders of the mantle, although a small 
amount, including pearly or nacreous material in some species, is laid down 
by other parts of this organ. The liquid secretion of lime salts becomes 
crystallized when mixed in a colloidal albumen which is also produced by 
the mantle. Several types of shelly material are laid down in definite layers, 
and the structure and composition may vary depending upon the family or 
genus of mollusks. The structure of a layer may be prismatic (made up of 
tiny, individual, closely packed prisms), foliated (layers built up of over- 
lapping leaves), nacreous (mother-of-pearl), granular (like grains of sugar 
stuck together), crossed laniellar (a common type in which the long lamellae 
are rectangular), or it may be homogejieous with no visible structure. The 
mineral character of these layers may be calcite (2.7 times as heavy as water) 
or aragonite (2.9 times as heavy as water), both of which are forms of 
calcium carbonate. 

The shell of the tellin clam (Tellina), for instance, is made up of three 
layers of calcium carbonate and the horny periostracum. The latter con- 



34 America}! Seashells 

sists of a very thin layer of conchiolin, probably not more than 0.003 n^"^- 
in thickness. In other clams, such as Area, it may be many times as thick. 
It is normally secreted from a group of cells situated just under the tip of the 
mantle. The three shell layers are: (i) The outer layer of shell which 
consists of elongate radial prisms of calcite. These are arranged in concen- 
tric bands which are plainly visible on the outer surface of the shell. (2) The 
middle layer which is entirely composed of aragonite in the form of "crossed 
lamella." This specialized structure is peculiar to mollusks. (3) The inner 
layer which is a homogeneous layer of porcellaneous material. 

The Pen Shells of the genus Pi72na commonly found on the west coast 
beaches of Florida offer an excellent demonstration of prismatic structure. 
When the surface is examined with a high-powered lens, it appears to be 
honeycombed. What you see are the ends of the needle-like prisms of 
calcite which, although closely packed together, are separated from each 
other by a thin varnish of conchiolin. By examining the edge of the broken 
shell you can make out the prisms in side view. 

Most clams continue to grow in size during lifetime, but the greatest in- 
crease takes place during the first year or two. A species may show con- 
siderable variation in its manner of growth under different living conditions 
at various localities. Thus the Pacific Razor Clam (Siliqiia patula) in its 
southern range in California grows much faster and reaches a length of 
about five inches in three years. In Alaska, however, it grows more slowly, 
taking five to eight years to reach the same size. Yet the northern colonies 
continue to grow for a greater length of time, some living for fifteen to 
eighteen years and eventually reaching a length of over six inches. This 
is also true of the Pacific Cockle {Clinocardhmi nuttalli) which in ten years 
grows to three inches in length in California, but in Alaska it survives six- 
teen years to reach a length of five inches. 

The maximum age is known for a few species of clams. It is believed 
that the giant Tridacna clam of the Indo-Pacific lives for perhaps a hundred 
years, but this has not been confirmed by experiments or accurate calcula- 
tions. The average age of the Atlantic Bay Scallop {Aeqiiipecten irradians) 
is about sixteen months, its maximum age only two or three years. The 
average age of a five-inch Pismo Clam (Tivela stidtonim) on the Pacific 
Coast is about eight years, its maximum age twenty-five years. The Com- 
mon Blue Adussel (Mytilus edulis) grows to about two inches the first year, 
to four inches the second year but, beyond this, it grows very little although 
it may live for a total of seven or eight years. The Soft Shell Clam {My a 
arenaria) takes about five years to reach an edible size of three or four inches 
and may live for ten years. The AVashington Clam {Saxidounis imttalli) lives 
ten to fifteen years or longer, while Nuttall's Gaper Clam {Schizothaenis 
nuttalli) may survive for seventeen years.

HOW THEY FEED 



35 



Normally one does not think of clams and oysters as being very active 
feeders and certainly, in comparison with the voracious methods of fish 
and squid, the bivalves are rather peaceful eaters. Yet in their characteristic 
way they are highly efficient and, in proportion to their size, possess a large 
and varied menu. Most clams feed on minute plants and, in a relatively short 
time, can filter from the sea water an extraordinary number of living diatoms 
and dinoflagellates — microscopic, swimming plants — and protozoa of the 
ocean. A few genera, such as the small Cuspidaria and Foromya clams, are 
carnivorous and feed upon small living or dead animals, usually crustaceans 
and annelid worms. 




Figure i i. Extended animals of some bivalves, showing various types of siphons. 

a, Mya arenaria Linne; b, Tellina agilis Stimpson; c, Tagelus plebeius Solander; 

d, Eiisis directus Conrad. (From A. E. Verrill 1873.) 

The bivalves fall into two general classes of feeders — suspension feeders 
which merely pump water through their mantle cavity and thus obtain free- 
swimming or suspended creatures from the water; or deposit feeders which 
suck up food from the muddy bottom with their long, mobile inhalant si- 
phons. Among the suspension feeders are the oysters, scallops, venus clams, 
cockles, the shipworms and many others. They may or may not possess 
siphons, but when present these are generally short. The deposit feeders 
include such forms as Tellina, Macoma and Abra which all have long siphons. 

Whether food is taken in through the inhalant siphon as in the tellins or 
through a slit in the mantle as in the scallops, it must pass over the gills. These 
filament-like organs are covered by a thin sheet of mucus. Food passing 
through the gills becomes ensnarled in the mucus which is transported by 
water currents and myriads of tiny, hair-like cilia. Mucus is constantly be- 



36 



American Seashells 



ing secreted and carried to the food grooves bordering the gills, along which 
the food-laden strands are carried to the mouth. 

Our common Atlantic Oyster and those in France are frequently found 
with green gills. The "green oysters" of Marennes, France, are famous 
for their supposed medicinal qualities. Americans are incHned to shy from 
* 'green oysters," because they fear the color may be a sign of spoilage. 
Oysters feeding upon the small diatom, Navicula ostrearia, digest these single- 
celled plants and absorb from them large quantities of blue pigment. In the 
tissues of the oyster's gills the pigment appears in the form of a sickly but 
quite harmless green. Occasionally, however, our oysters may take on a 
general greenish tint, not due to diatoms but to an increase in the amount 
of copper in the tissues. Such oysters have a rather brassy taste.

The clam has considerable choice in what it wishes to eat, and it can 
reject undesirable particles of sand or oversized pieces of food. The gills 
and the two fleshy palps, or flaps guarding the mouth, help in sorting out 
the right-sized organisms. Acceptable food is taken into the funnel-shaped 
mouth, passed through a short esophagus and enters the stomach. Inside the 
stomach, a further selection of food may take place with indigestible matter 
being passed on immediately through the intestine. The best food passes from 
the stomach into the digestive gland where it is broken down chemically 
and absorbed into the blood stream.

Life of the Cla?ns 37 

Lying close to the stomach is a sac which contains a cucumber-shaped, 
jelly-hke crystaUine style. The end of this style projects into the stomach. 
It rotates clockwise and dissolves its enzymes in the stomach which aid in 
digesting the food, that is, in converting starch into sugar. The style, numer- 
ous ciha and the furrows on the stomach wall aid in churning the food. 

The fecal pellets of mollusks are often very distinctive for the various 
genera and species. Some are cylindrical rods, others elongated strings or 
ribbons, and a few consist of strands wrapped up in round balls. In cross- 
section, some rods are characteristically bi- or trilobed. 

Feeding is not done at all times, although a great part of a bivalve's life 
is spent in securing food. The oyster, for instance, spends from seventeen 
to twenty hours of each 24-hour period in taking in water for the purpose 
of feeding and breathing. Individuals living in the intertidal zone and left 
dry by receding tides or exposed to water heavily charged with silt spend 
considerably less time feeding. During cold periods, when the water tempera- 
ture falls below 40° F, the oyster goes into a state of hibernation, and it 
ceases to feed because of the lack of coordination of the ciliary motion along 
the surface of the gills. Under ideal conditions, the Giant Pacific Oyster 
(Crassostrea gigas) filters 5% quarts of water per hour at 77° F (i quart at 
34° F). In a year, the total amount would fill a 1 0,000-gallon tank car. 

Perhaps the most startling modification of obtaining food nutrients is 
exhibited in the giant Tridacna clams of the Indo-Pacific reefs. These clams 
literally "farm" colonies of brown-colored algal plants (Zooxajitbellae) in 
their huge, exposed mantle edges. Unlike most clams, the Tridacnas spread 
their valves open and expose their mantles to as much sunlight as possible 
for the benefit of these single-celled seaweeds. In addition, small, fleshy 
tubercles grow on the surface of the mantle in which are located lens-like, 
clear cells. Sunlight can thus penetrate down into the flesh and be diffused 
into areas which otherwise would not receive enough light for the algae. 
Surplus plant cells are engulfed by phagocyte blood cells of the clam and 
transported to the digestive gland for absorption as food. The giant clams 
also feed in the conventional gill-to-mouth manner and are therefore not 
entirely dependent on the algae. The algae, however, must have a clam 
as a host in order to survive. This peculiar symbiosis is found to a lesser 
extent in the Bear Paw Clam (Hippopus), the Heart Cockle (Corculum) and 
the nudibranch, Phestilla. This phenomenon is not to be confused with the 
pathologic entry of the parasitic blue-green algae in fresh-water mussels, 
Anodonta and Unio. 

While the gills are the main organs for catching, sorting and transporting 
food in the majority of clams, they are limited to respiratory functions in 
a few groups. The smallest and most inefficient gills are found in the primi- 
tive protobranchs {Nuctila, Nuculana, etc.) and in the small, highly evolved 



38 American Se ash ells 

septibranch clams (Poromya and Cuspidaria). In order to make up for the 
loss of efficient food-gathering gills, the palps near the mouth have become 





Figure 14. The pair of proboscides in the Nut Clams, Nucula, sweep up food and

of clams, a, X5; b and c, ends of the proboscides. Xio. (After K. Hirasaka 1927.) 

very specialized. In the Nucula Nut Clams, a pair of strong, muscular, con- 
tractile organs serve as food gatherers. These proboscides are very flexible, 
moving about freely in all directions. Food material is picked up by the tip 
and is carried swiftly down a large groove in the proboscis to a palp pouch 
and then to the stomach by means of minute cilia. E. S. Morse very aptly 
described the action of these appendages in our Atlantic Nut Clam, Nucula 
proxima: 

Without seeing the behaviour of these appendages it is difficult to appre- 
ciate the remarkable action of these feeding organs. The graceful move- 
ments of these beautiful and translucent appendages, exceeding the length 
of the shell, sweeping rapidly the bottom of the dish in which they are 
confined, or even turned back and feeding on the surface of the shell, are 
a most curious and interesting sight. 

HOW THEY BREATHE 

Oddly enough, the gills of the bivalves are not primarily used for respira- 
tion, despite their conspicuous size. As has been noted, their main function 
is in connection with feeding. Some experts deny their role as respiratory 
organs entirely, claiming that the mantle with its extremely effective blood 
supply serves as the main place of oxygen and carbon dioxide exchange. 
It has been found that blood coming from the mantle to the heart is com- 
pletely charged with oxygen received from the sea water. Undoubtedly, 
however, the gills do absorb oxygen to some extent. Indirectly, the gills 
are extremely useful in respiration, since they produce the all-important 
currents which bring in oxygen and remove carbon dioxide dissolved in the 
water. 



Life of the Cla?ns 39 

A certain amount of respiration may take place even when the valves 
of certain bivalves are completely shut during exposure to dryness or to 
heat from the sun. What little air may be trapped within the mantle cavity 
of the animal is soon used up. Oxygen is then obtained anerobically (with- 
out contact with air) by cleavage of reserve glycogen substances stored in 
the clam's tissues. Carbon dioxide builds up and is dissolved in the fluid 
in the mantle cavity, and the resulting increase in acidity may dissolve or 
etch away portions of the shell. Shells of oysters and the Patella limpets 
vv^hich are kept dry on the rocky coast for unusually long periods show 
considerable etching on the inside. Shells of the Date Mussels {Lithophaga), 
which live in a small volume of water in their rock burrows, are etched in 
this manner, while those specimens which live in the same volume of well- 
aerated water are not etched. 

Bivalves can be forced to cease respiration for several days without 
succumbing, but they are very susceptible to polluted waters and excess 
amounts of silt. The "red tide" caused severe destruction to the marine fauna 
on the west coast of Florida in 1946, and for several years afterward the 
"shelling" on famous Sanibel Island was little better than it is on Coney 
Island Beach, New York. "Red tides" have occurred from time to time in 
California, Washington State, Japan, Austraha and elsewhere. They are caused 
by an unusual increase in the numbers of single-celled dinoflagellates, Gony- 
aiilax. It is believed that billions of these organisms not only deplete the 
oxygen supply but also clog the gills of fish, moUusks and other animals which 
die in vast numbers and further befoul the ocean. Fortunately, these "red 
tides" spend themselves out, and the coastal waters return to normal in a 
few years. 

Another species of Gojiyaulax (G. catanella) may be ingested by mus- 
sels and clams and, although it does no harm to the mollusk, it is highly toxic 
to humans who may eat the infected shellfish. A number of deaths have 
occurred on both of our coasts from this type of mussel poisoning. There 
is no way of distinguishing poisonous from sound mussels by their appear- 
ance, and heat does not destroy the poison. Mussel poisoning occurs along 
the California coast from May 15 to October 15. There is another such 
center in Nova Scotia. 

Among the various schemes of classification of the bivalves, the type 
of gill structure has been used by many students of phylogeny (the study 
of molluscan ancestral trees), such as Lankester, Pelseneer, Ridewood and 
others. Opponents to this system, such as Neumayr, Munier-Chalmas, Dall, 
Cotton and others, have based their classification on the hinges of the shell 
valves. Neither system is without its weaknesses, and in some modern schemes 
the two systems are employed together. 

There are four main types of gills: (i) Protobranch, in which the gills 



40 



American Se ash ells 



are flat, plate-like, unreflected lamellae and are regarded as the most primi- 
tive (Nucula, Yoldia, etc.); (2) Filibranch, in which the gills are long 
curtains folded back against themselves and held close to each other by the 




Figure 15. Diagrammatic cross-sections of clams showing the major types of gill 
structure, a, protobranch; b, filibranch; c, eulamellibranch; d, septibranch. 

interlocking of the tiny cilia on the surface of the gill filaments (arks, mus- 
sels, scallops, etc.); (3) Eulamellibranch, similar to the filibranchs except that 
the gill curtains are united by cross-channels (astartes, cardiums, venus clams, 
tellins and many others); (4) Septibranch, which have very degenerate gill 
structures consisting of two pallial chambers with only gill slits or very 
reduced gill filaments acting as windows to the chambers (Cuspidaria and 
Poromya). 



HOW THEY REPRODUCE 

The staid bivalve has made his share of contributions to experiments in 
sex and reproduction, and throughout the class we find varying degrees of 
sexual differentiation, as well as all manner of ways of insuring proper fertili- 
zation, protection of the young and thus the continuation of the species. 

The pelecypods have no copulatory organs or other external sexual 
characteristics, with the exception that in certain species of fresh-water 
mussels, the marine astartes and a few other genera, the two sexes can be 
distinguished by the shape of the adult shell. The majority of the bivalves 
as a group are predominantly of separate sexes, but at least four percent of 
those adequately studied are known to deviate from the strictly dioecious, 
or unisexual, condition. 

A few species are true hermaphrodites in which the same individual 
contains both female and male sex organs which may produce eggs and 
sperm simultaneously. In this group are found certain species of Pecten, 
Tridacna (the Giant Pacific Clam), Kellia, Dinocardiwn, Gemma, Tivela 
(the Pismo Clam), Tlyracia, Porojnya, the shipworm Teredo diegensis and 
the fresh-water genera Anodonta, Pisidium and Sphaeriwn. In some of these 



Life of the Clams 41 

the eggs are fertilized within the mantle cavity, and the young complete 
development to the adult form in brood pouches on the gills of the parent. 
Usually self-fertilization does not occur, for in the majority of these species 
the sperm is discharged before the eggs are mature in the same individual 
(protandric hermaphroditism). 

Other kinds of bivalves are accustomed to practicing sex reversal in 
which the early part of their lives is spent as males and their "adulthood" 
as females. In the Quahog {Mercenaria mere en aria), nearly all individuals 
experience a male phase in which functional sperm is produced while the 
clam is only a few months old. Following this initial male phase, about half 
of the population turns female to produce eggs, while the other half remains 
male. No further sex change takes place. 

Sex reversal is apparently very popular among some of the oysters, 
such as our native Pacific Coast Ostrea liirida. In this species there is a series 
of male and female phases. There may be three changes within a single 
year. Usually the male phase comes on first. Alternating sexuality also 
occurs in our Atlantic Oyster {Crassostrea virginica), but the early sex organs 
are capable of turning toward either male- or femaleness. It is not known, at 
present, to what extent environmental conditions determine the direction 
of sex chan^-e. It has been shown, however, that under unfavorable circum- 
stances, when circulation of water is poor and the food supply low, there are 
more female oysters in a colony. When conditions improve, the percentage 
of males increases considerably. 

Thorough studies have now been made to show that normally no sex 
reversal occurs and that the sexes are separate and of equal numbers in a 
given colony in the following species: Modiolus deviissiis, Mytihis calif orni- 
anus, Septifer bifurcatus, Anomia sivtplex, Mytihis edtilis, Fetricola pholadi- 
forfnis, Donax goiildi, Mya arenaria (Soft-shell Clam) and the Angel Wing, 
Barnea costata. 

The number of eggs produced by the female bivalve may vary consider- 
ably depending upon the species and environmental conditions. Species 
which retain the fertilized eggs within their bodies for further development 
invariably produce fewer eggs than those species which discharge them into 
the water. The oysters are probably among the greatest molluscan producers 
of eggs. C. R. Elsey estimates that one female Crassostrea gigas of Japan 
and our northwest Pacific Coast may discharge into the water each year 
eggs numbering looo to the eighth power. If all survived in five generations, 
the aggregate would be large enough to make eight worlds like ours. Need- 
less to say, enemies and unfavorable conditions kill off most of the young. 

In contrast to this prodigious eflFort on the part of the oyster, the Dwarf 
Turton Clam (Turtonia iimmta) deposits only 12 to 20 eggs which are 
neatly encased in oval tgg masses of gelatinous material. While most species 



42 



American Seashells 



of Nucula Nut Clams discharge their eggs freely into the water, one New 
England species, N. delphinodoiita, deposits from 20 to 70 tiny, opaque 
brown eggs in a gelatinous sac which is attached to the posterior end of the 
valves of the shell. Small bits of debris and mud stick to the outside of this 
sac, which probably serve as a camouflage. Many bivalves keep the develop- 
ing young within the mantle cavity or in the meshes of the gills until the 
tiny shells are quite well advanced in development. With the aid of a high- 
powered lens one may readily see tiny juvenile clams inside the translucent 
adult shells of such genera as Gemma, Fardstarte, Psephidia, Transennella, 
Kellia, Lepton and Lasaea. The odd Dwarf Milner Clam of California {Mil- 
Jieria minima) incubates about 50 young in a peculiar external pouch. The 
valves are indented on the ventral margins to form a neat exterior pocket. 
To prevent the young from dropping out, a sheath of periostracum is 
stretched over the entrance. When the small clam shells have grown suffi- 
ciently to fend for themselves, the sheath is "unzipped," and all tumble out 
into the free world.

The spotted siphons are shown projecting from the wood in which these bivalves

Clapp 195 1.) 

In practically all cases, the sperm from bivalves is liberated into the 
water where it comes in contact with unfertilized eggs that have been pre- 
viously released. In cases where eggs are retained by females, the sperm is 
sucked in through the inhalant siphon of the mother. Only one instance of 
pseudo-copulation is known. In 1951 workers at the W. F. Clapp Labora- 
tories observed Gould's Shipworm {Teredo) placing their exhalant siphons 
down into their neighbors' inhalant siphons and discharging what is pre- 
sumed to have been sperm.

HOW THEY SENSE AND SEE 

Bivalves are the least "brainy" of the moUusks and, although the central 
nervous system forms a rather complicated latticework throughout the body, 
its three pairs of "brains" are merely swellings or ganglia in the larger nerves. 
The pair of so-called cerebral gangUa control the actions of the lip palps 
near the mouth, parts of the mantle, and they also receive "nerve notices" 
from the tiny organs of balance, the otocysts. The second major pair of 
ganglia are the pedals which supply the foot. This pair is large in the clams 
that use the foot for digging or burrowing, but it is extremely small or 
aborted in the oysters in which the foot is not used. The third pair, or vis- 
ceral ganglia, is usually the largest and supplies the adductor muscles and 
the visceral mass. The remarkable eyes of the scallops are connected with 
this pair of visceral ganglia. 

Many of the bivalve larvae possess true paired eyes, but in all cases these 
are lost when the animal transforms into the adult stage. The adults of a 
number of clams and mussels have developed pigment spots sensitive to 
changing light, but in the scallops true eyes are well-developed. When the 
shell of a scallop is open there can be seen just within the margin of each 
valve a line of small, brilliant, emerald-like dots on the mantle, each of which 
is a small eye fully equipped with cornea, focusing lens, receptive retina and 
conducting nerves. 

HOW THEY BURROW AND SWIM 

There are bivalves that swim, leap, crawl and burrow deeply in mud, 
sand or clay, and some that bore into wood, rock and even lead casings of 
submarine cables. Even the rock-bound oyster and the stuck-in-the-mud 
clam have their days of wandering about as free-swimming lan^ae before 
they settle down to a life of permanent attachment or clumsy crawling. 

The habit of swimming among adult bivalves is rare. The scallops and 
the Lima File Clams not infrequently swim. Only under the abnormal condi- 
tion of finding themselves "unearthed" do the Eiisis Razor Clams and the 
Solemya Veiled Clams practice jet propulsion through the water. The Razor 
Clam swims backward in quick, short jerks by first extending its long cylin- 
drical foot out from the shell and then suddenly withdrawing it with great 
force. This action, together with the closing of the shell valves, quickly 
forces the water within the mantle cavity out through the openings at the 
anterior or foot end. Thus the razor clam darts through the water with its 
pumping foot to the rear. In Solemya, the foot is in front of the animal 
as it swims. In this case the water is admitted around the foot but is ex- 
pelled from the opposite end through the siphons. 



44 



American Seashells 



The highly developed swimming ability of the scallops accounts for 
the migratory powers of the great schools of these active bivalves. One 
would normally expect the direction of swimming taken by a scallop snap- 
ping its valves together to be "backward" in the direction of the hinges. 
Although that type of movement is on rare occasions used as an escape 
measure, the typical swimming movement is in the opposite direction with 
the free edge of the shell going in front, so that the animal appears to be 
taking a series of bites out of the water. This odd action is made possible 
by the vertical, curtain-like edges of the muscular mantle. When the valves 
are snapped shut by the powerful adductor muscle, water is driven out, not 
past the mantle curtains but through the regions around the hinge or ears of 
the shell. By manipulating these curtains, which can be extended or with- 
drawn locally, the scallop is able to vary the amount and position of exodus 
of water and hence can direct its course. If accidentally turned over onto 
the wrong valve, the scallop can execute a neat flip and regain its normal 
position. 

While the scallop always swims with its valves in a horizontal plane, 
the Lw/^ File Clams most frequently progress edgewise, that is, with the 
breadth of the valves vertical or slightly oblique. The long, colorful tenta- 
cles of the Lifna keep the animal momentarily suspended in water while 
the valves are being opened in preparation for another "bite" forward. The 
Li7na is a poor swimmer and, because of its habit of building nests under 
rocks, apparently has no incentive to undertake migrations as is done by

Life of the Clams 45 

the scallops. Scallops of the genus Chlamys are equally poor swimmers and, 
unlike adult Pecten, spin small byssal threads for attachment to the bottom. 

Burrowing in sand and mud is accomplished by the foot of the bivalve. 
The principle is the same in all digging clams. The foot is slowly protruded 
with the pointed tip wriggling down into the mud. During this extension 
the end of the foot is kept small, but when it reaches its greatest extension 
the end is suddenly swelled into a great bulb and the whole foot becomes very 
rigid. This is accomplished by injecting blood into the foot. The bulbous 
end serves as an anchor while the clam withdraws the foot and pulls its 
entire shell deeper into the mud. In the case of the Razor Clam, this action 
is accompanied by a jet of water against the mud ahead. The dislodged mud 
is washed up the sides of the shell and out the burrow. The action is similar 
to the pile driver that opens a way for the pile by a somewhat similar stream 
of water. 

Because of its long, powerful foot the Razor Clam is capable of leaping. 
Generally, when this clam is lying on the surface of the mud, the foot is 
bent back under the shell and is then suddenly made rigid with the result 
that it is straightened out with great rapidity. In some cases the animal 
may turn itself end over end. 

Many types of clams are especially adapted to boring into hard clay, 
shale, sandstone and concrete. The Date Mussels, Lithophaga, possess acid- 
secreting glands as an aid to penetrating limestone. The shell of the clam 
would of course be dissolved by this acid were it not for the thick, protective 
covering of periostracum. The Saxicave Borers, Hiatella, may live attached 
by a byssus on surfaces that they cannot penetrate, or they may bore into 
soft rock. The boring of the adults is wholly mechanical and is accomplished 
by rubbing the edges of their shell valves against the rock. Hiatella stays near 
enough to the surface to allow its siphons to protrude just outside its cone- 
shaped burrow. In three years the burrow is only three fourths of an inch 
in length and, after eight years of constant grinding and new gowth of 
shell, it is only one and a half inches in length. 

The shipworms burrow long distances into the wood but retain contact 
with the "outside world" by means of the long fleshy, tube-like extension 
of the body. Boring is accomplished by the two valves at the anterior end of 
the tunnel. The denticulated ridges of the shell are the cutting tools, and 
the foot and muscles aid in rotating the shells back and forth. Burrowing 
may progress at the rate of as much as four inches a month. In the genus 
Bankia, at the posterior end of the worm-like animal there are two tiny, 
feathery pallets. These are used to plug the entrance of the burrow, thus 
giving protection from enemies, changes in salinity or other adverse condi- 
tions. When the shipworm is undisturbed, the pallets are drawn inside 
and the siphons extended into the water for breathing and feeding. 



CHAPTER IV 

Lives of the 
Other MoUusks 



In addition to the bivalves and snail classes, the mollusks include three other 
groups which are not so frequently seen at the seashore and whose combined 
number of living species probably does not exceed two thousand. Two 
of these classes, the Amphineiira or Chitons and the Scaphopoda or Tusk- 
shells, are among the lowliest and most sluggish of the mollusks, but the 
third class, the well-known Cephalopoda, including the squid and octopuses, 
contains the largest, fastest and most ferocious of all backboneless animals. 

THE SQUID AND OCT 0?\JSYS— CEPHALOPODA 

The octopuses and the giant squid have been spine-chilling characters 
in adventure tales from the days of the ancient Greeks to the undersea film 
thrillers of Hollywood. Nothing seems more appropriate for a horror scene 
then the sudden appearance of a tentacle-lashing, beady-eyed octopus just 
as the hero-diver finds the long-lost treasure chest. And few authors of 
strange sailing voyages can resist retelling the numerous instances in which 
gigantic squid have wrapped their arms about the riggings and dragged ship 
and hapless crew to the bottom. 

But despite the fanciful nature of most, if not all, of these stories, there 
arc enough scientific facts to convince the skeptic of the ferocity, speed 
and unusual intelligence of these creatures. Canadian and American fisher- 
men have long been familiar with giant squid and have often captured 

46 



Lives of the Other Mollusks 47 

crippled individuals and used them for bait. A number of these giants have 
been brought into museums, and others, stranded on beaches after storms, 
have been measured and recorded by reliable observers. Architeuthis of the 
North Atlantic waters is know^n to reach a total length of 55 feet. The 
longest arms of this specimen are 3 5 feet, while the length of the body from 
tip of tail to the base of the arms is 20 feet. The greatest circumference 
of the body is 1 2 feet. Sperm whales which feed upon smaller squid have 
often been locked in battle with these giants. The skin of these whales is 
sometimes heavily marked with circular scars caused by the suckers of the 
squid. 

The octopus does not reach a very large size. The largest known species 
occurs on the west coast of North America where, in Alaska, Octopus 
punctatus attains a length of 16 feet or a radial spread of nearly 28 feet. 
However, the arms are very small in diameter, and a specimen of such long 
proportions has a body length of not more than a foot. The octopus oc- 
casionally found in the Lower Florida Keys is usually less than three feet 
in radial spread. A dead specimen cast on a beach near Nassau, Bahama 
Islands, was reported to have an arm length of five feet, and it was estimated 
that the entire creature weighed about 200 pounds. This, however, is with- 
out verification. Recent reports of octopus holes 100 feet across seen in 
the Bahamas from the air were made by untrained observers. There is no 
satisfactory evidence that any of these species of Octopus has ever inten- 
tionally attacked man, or that any person has ever been seriously injured 
by one. The octopus is a rather sluggish and timid creature, seeking shelter in 
holes and crevices among the rocks, and is usually small. It feeds mainly on bi- 
valve mollusks but will also eat snails, fish and Crustacea. Its hideouts along the 
shore can usually be detected by the presence of empty shells. 

Locomotion among the cephalopods varies from a slow, "tentacle-walk- 
ing" pace, both in and out of water, to the rapid, jet-propulsion darts which 
are so characteristic of the squid. The so-called aerial "flight" of squid, like 
that of the flyingfish, is actually a gliding operation and largely depends 
upon the initial speed attained under water. Squid have frequently landed 
on the decks of ships a dozen or more feet above the surface of the ocean. 
When a school of squid is alarmed by an approaching ship or by marauding 
fish, the fleeing squid dart from the water simultaneously and all in one 
direction rather than individually fanning out in several directions in the 
manner of flying fish. 

The squid darts backward, forward, or in any other direction by means 
of the reaction of the jet of water which is ejected with great force from 
the siphon, and direction of movement is controlled by the bending of the 
siphon. Even when it is confined to a limited space, as in a fishpound, it is 
not an easv matter to capture it with a dip-net, so rapid is its movement. 



48 American Se ash ells 

When it is darting rapidly, the lobes of the caudal fin are closely wrapped 
around the body, and the arms are held tightly together to form a streamlined 
outline. Except when attacking or escaping, the squid swims less strenuously, 
using the caudal fin as a balancing organ. 

There are few sights as interesting as that of squid engaged in capturing 
and devouring young mackerel. During the summer this chase may be 
observed from certain wharves in New England. In attacking mackerel 
the squid darts backward among the fish with the velocity of an arrow, and 
then turns obliquely to one side and seizes a fish, which is almost instantly 
killed by a bite in the back of the neck by the squid's sharp beak. The bite 
is always made in the same place, cutting out a triangular piece of flesh, and 
is deep enough to penetrate to the spinal cord. The attacks are not always 
successful and may be repeated a dozen times before one of the wary fish 
can be caught. Between attacks a squid may suddenly drop to the bottom 
and, resting on the sand, change its color to that of the sand so perfectly 
as to be almost invisible. Ordinarily, when swimming, it is thickly spotted 
with red and brown but, when darting among the mackerel, it appears trans- 
lucent and pale. The schools of young mackerel often move close to shore 
where the water is shallow and offers more protection. In their eagerness 
to capture fish, the squid frequently force themselves up on the beach where 
they perish by the hundreds. At such times they often discharge their ink 
in large quantities. 

Many species of octopuses and squid possess an ink sac and, in moments 
of great excitation they may expel a large cloud of black or brown liquid 
through the siphon. The ink is of a caustic nature and, in addition to its 
use as a "smoke screen," it is believed to be distasteful to hungry fish. Two 
sources of sepia ink are a species of squid found along the southeastern 
coast of China and another found in the Mediterranean Sea. 

Many geologic eras ago the cephalopods possessed large and showy shells. 
Today, however, shells produced by this class are a rarity. The most spec- 
tacular shell is found produced by the Indo-Pacific Chambered Nautilus, 
Naiitihis p077ipiliiis. On our shores, the small, white, spirally coiled shell of 
Spirilla is frequently encountered on southern beaches. The three-inch-long 
Spirula squid which produces this shell is a denizen of deep water. In other 
squid the internal shell has been reduced to a simple slab of chalky material 
(the cuttlefish bone fed to canaries) or, in the case of the Loligo squid, to 
a thin, elongate shaft of transparent, horny material. 

By an odd turn of fate, squid are heavily preyed upon by adult cod, 
mackerel and other fish, and no doubt some young mackerel which have 
escaped by a tentacle's breadth have lived to devour later their would-be 
assassins. Squid are taken in large quantities in nets and weirs each year, and 
they constitute one of the main fish baits on the Grand Banks. They are 



Lives of the Other Mollusks 49 

frequently eaten by peoples of the Mediterranean area and the Orient but to 
a much lesser extent by Americans. 

In contrast to the speedy squid, the octopus is relatively a slow-moving 
creature, although it can swim away at a fairly rapid rate by using the same 
water-jet system of propulsion; it lacks the caudal fins of the squid. The 
underside of the eight arms of the octopus are studded along their entire 
lengths with cup-like disks or acetabula. When a sucker is pressed against 
any smooth surface, the center is withdrawn to create a vacuum which en- 
sures a powerful attachment. An octopus can "tentacle" along with remark- 
able agility and at night may even take to short excursions out of water. I 
have known of an octopus kept in a small aquarium in Bermuda to push the 
lid off the top, crawl down the table and off the veranda in an attempt to 
reach the ocean. It crawled more than a hundred feet toward the sea before 
it succumbed and was attacked by ants. There have been many authentic 
accounts of encounters with octopus on exposed tidal reefs, and a few ob- 
servers state that the octopus can keep up with a man in a brisk walk. 

Even more astounding than the locomotive powers of the cephalopods 
are their amazing displays of bright, glowing lights and color changes. The 
shallow-water species have embedded in their skin chromatophores whose 
expansion and contraction are controlled by the nervous system. Emotion, 
excitation or response to the color of surrounding objects will effect the 
color changes in the octopus. Among the deep-water squid, many of which 
are phosphorescent, gorgeous underwater pyrotechnics are frequently dis- 
played which far outshine the brightest of fireflies and glowworms. Specimens 
of Lycoteuthis brought up from considerable depths and kept alive in chilled 
water have had their photographs taken by their own light. The body looks 
as if it were adorned by a diadem of brilliant gems. The middle organs of 
the eyes shine with ultramarine blue, the lateral ones with a pearly sheen. 
Those toward the front of the lower surface of the body give out a ruby-red 
light, while those behind are snow-white or pearly, with the exception of 
the middle organ which is sky-blue. Some squid have astonishingly com- 
plex bull's-eye lanterns; others have mirrored searchlights. A species of Heter- 
oteuthis is able to spurt out a luminous secretion from its funnel and the 
jet of water following it draws out the bright globules into long, shining 
threads. 

The sexes in the cephalopods are separate, except for two or three 
isolated examples. In most of the species females are much more numerous, 
the ratio of females to males being loo to 15 in some species of the Loligo 
squid and 100 to 25 in some of the Octopus. The most outstanding feature 
is the morphological differences between the two sexes. In the Argonauta 
or Paper Nautilus, the females are 10 to 15 times as large as the males which 
completely lack the beautiful shell used by females for storing eggs. The 



50 American Seashells 

female also differs in having its two dorsal arms enlarged at the end to form 
a veil or mold with which she secretes a shell. In a vast number of species, 
the males are characterized by having one of the arms modified to form a 
copulatory organ. This arm is known as the hectocotylus. In certain octo- 
pods, including the Argonauta, this arm is broken off and left in the female 
to fertilize the eggs. In all the other groups the hectocotylus is simply held 
inside the female until copulation is complete. It is interesting to note that 
more than 2000 years ago Aristotle recorded the presence of the hecto- 
cotylus arm in the octopus and correctly associated it with its sexual purpose. 

In the males the sperm is gathered into large sacs or spermatophores 
of several inches in length. These sacs find their way in some unknown 
manner into the hectocotylus arm. Each sac contains a tiny, coiled, spring- 
like filament which spews the ripe sperm out of the sac. 

The eggs of the cephalopods are laid in various ways. They may be 
single and floating in the pelagic species, such as Oegopsida, congregated 
together in a shelly nest as in Argonmita, laid in jelly tubes as in the Loligo 
squid, or anchored in grape-like bunches under rock ledges as in the Octo- 
pus. The embryo emerges from the tgg fully developed and does not have 
a free veliger stage. With the aid of a lens it is possible to see the beautiful 
splotches of bright chromatophores in the skin of the tiny young even before 
they hatch. About a hundred eggs are laid at one sitting by the octopus; 
the squid tgg strings from one female may contain over 40,000 eggs. Some 
species of octopuses take pains to watch over their brood of eggs and from 
time to time may carefully go over them with their tentacles to remove dirt. 

THE CHn01<iS—AMPHINEURA 

Amateurs and professionals alike have found the chitons or coat-of-mail 
shells an extremely interesting and fruitful field of study, and no collection 
is complete without at least three or four representatives of this strange 
group of mollusks. The chitons closely resemble the gastropods except that 
they bear eight shelly plates. For those who wish to excel in a more serious 
study of a relatively small class of mollusks, no more inviting series of species 
awaits the collector than our chitons of the rocky shores. They are dealt 
with in this book in some detail, for no popular shell book has hitherto at- 
tempted to open the doors to this supposedly "difficult and poorly known" 
group. 

There are nearly fifty species in our Atlantic waters and perhaps twice 
that number on the Pacific Coast, and yet this represents fewer species 
than are found in the single family of Wentletraps or Epitonium. Some 
private collectors, such as the late Dr. R. B. Bales, were able in a few years 
to make larg^er and finer collections of Florida chitons than are found even 



Lives of the Other Molliisks 51 

now in our leading museums. Hitherto unknown species await the enthusi- 
astic speciahst in chitons. 

Except for the more easily recognized and common species, such as 
the Pacific Coast Katherina tunicata and A7mcula stelleri, most identifica- 
tions require a simple understanding of the various parts of the shells and 
the patience to remove one or two of the eight valves for observation under 
a hand lens. Tourist collectors have little time to devote to the special but 
simple methods of collecting and preserving chitons, and unless they are 
willing to take to the shore a bucket, penknife, some thin slabs of wood or 
small glass plates and some soft twine, it w ould be best for them to concen- 
trate their searches on the olives and cowries. 

No one man has done more for the encouragement of chiton collecting 
in America than Dr. S. Stillman Berry of Redlands, Cahfomia, and we can- 
not do better than to follow his simple directions. Curled-up specimens 
in collections signify ignorance of methods or lack of time while in the 
field. The chitons are easily flipped from the rock surfaces by quickly in- 
serting a knife blade beneath the edge of the animal. If the chiton is then 
quickly transferred to the wet surface of a piece of shingle or glass of the 
appropriate width, it may be possible to flatten the creature before it curls 
into a ball. Wood and chiton should be tightly wound with twine or strips 
of cotton cloth, so that the animal will die in this flattened position. The 
bound chiton may be soaked in 60 to 80 percent alcohol for an hour or more, 
or in fresh water, for killing. Unbind, scrape the meat away from the under- 
side, being careful not to damage the outer rim or girdle. Rewrap on the 
wood and set in the hot sun or oven to dry thoroughly. If scientific study 
is to be done at a later date, it is best to keep a few specimens permanently 
in a jar of about 70 percent alcohol. When specimens roll up before they 
can be straightened against your piece of wood, they may be dropped into 
the bucket of sea water where they will eventually straighten out and allow 
a second attempt of transfer. 

Habitats of chitons are usually specialized for each species, some being 
found only on the underside of rocks between the tide levels, others on 
wave-dashed headlands, a few in tidepools, others only in deeper waters 
off-shore. Phiiia pen shells recently cast ashore often have tiny chitons at- 
tached on the outside of the shell. Those who do not have dredging facilities 
may acquire the latter species through exchange or by purchase from several 
of our excellent shell dealers. A watchful eye and variation in collecting 
localities will soon bring familiarization with the various habitats of most 
of the species.

Identification of Chitons 

It is essential for accurate identifications to refer to one or more ot the 
ten technical terms used in describing the various parts of the chiton. A few 
minutes' study of figure i8 will prepare the reader for the photographs, 
identification drawings and descriptions of the species. Jumping to conclu- 
sions from the photographs instead of ascertaining the family or genus first 
will lead to discourag-ino- results.

Figure i8. Parts of the chiton shell. 



All the chitons discussed in this book bear eight shelly valves which 
cover the body of the creature and are bound together by a leathery girdle. 
The chitons without valves (Aplacophora) are too rare to be conveniently 
included here. A view of the underside of a living chiton will show the 
rather small, separate head and its mouth and, behind this, the larger, ob- 
long foot. On each side of the foot is a straight row of closely packed gills. 
The head bears no tentacles or eyes, although the valves of many chitons 
bear numerous shell eyes. 

Each chiton possesses three types of valves: (i) the anterior valve at 
the head end, (2) six intermediate valves, and (3) the posterior valve at 
the hind end. The shape and ornamentation of these valves are used for 
identification purposes, and for this reason the various areas of the valves 
have been named. Removal of the last two valves by the soaking of dried 



Lives of the Other Mollusks 53 

specimens in warm water for five or ten minutes will usually afford sufficient 
information. The upper surface as well as the under surface of each valve 
has characteristic areas which aid in identification. 

In one family of chitons, the Chitonidae, the upper surfaces of the valves 
of some species bear microscopic eyes which consist of an eye capsule, 
cornea, iris, lens, retina and optic nerve, but they are probably useful only 
in sensing changes of light intensity and passing shadows. 

The girdle is the leathery rim which encircles the eight valves. In 
some species the girdle entirely or partially covers the valves. The surface of 
the girdle may be covered with beautiful little scales or with spines, hairs or 
tufts of bristles. Unfortunately these characters vary among individuals 
and cannot always be used to separate species, although the general types 
are fairly reliable in distinguishing genera. 

The radula or ribbon of teeth is very long, and is composed of thick 
and dark amber-colored teeth. There are usually about seventeen teeth in 
each transverse row, in the following order reckoned from the center: one 
simple, small central; flanked on each side first by a translucent minor lateral 
and then by a major lateral which bears a conspicuous black cusp; next, two 
boss-like uncinal plates; then a twisted spatulate uncinal; and, finally, three 
scale-like external uncini. The radula of the chitons have not been demon- 
strated as useful characters in separating species because of their great vari- 
ability, although some workers claim that the major laterals are useful. 

The sexes are separate in the chitons. Some species lay eggs in a glu- 
tinous, indistinct mass. There may be a free-swimming veliger stage in some 
species. In other species the young live under the mantle edge of the mother 
for protection. 

THE TUSK-SHELLS— SCAPHOPODA 

To our Northwest Pacific Indians and our early pioneers the tusk-shells 
were a familiar form of wampum, but today few Americans would recog- 
nize one on sight. The 200-odd known living species are for the most part 
inhabitants of deep water, although a few of our American species live in rela- 
tively shallow water and are frequently washed ashore. The shells resemble 
miniature elephant tusks open at both ends, and the sluggish creature lives 
embedded obliquely in sand and mud, with only the small end of the shell 
projecting above the surface of the substrate. 

Like many gastropods, the scaphopods possess a single shell and a set 
of radular teeth but, like the bivalves, they have a nonlobed velum in the 
larval or veliger stage, and in adulthood have a wedge-shaped foot and lack 
a definite head. They lack gills but absorb oxygen from the sea water 
through the tissues of the mantle. Water is first taken in through the small 



54 



American Seashells 



posterior end of the tube-like shell. The water slowly builds up inside the 
mantle cavity of the animal over a period of about ten mmutes; then, after 
a short period of rest, the water is suddenly expelled in the opposite direction. 
As in the manner of feeding among the bivalves, ciliated ridges within the 
mantle ensure passage of food particles to the region of the mouth. How- 
ever, the primary method of feeding is by means of a number of long, ce- 
phalic filaments or captacula which are anchored to the two flattened lobes 
flanking the mouth. The club-shaped ends of these tiny filaments are tactile 
and prehensile and are capable of capturing Foraminifera and other similar 
minute organisms. These captacula project out in all directions from the 



-CftPTPiCULUM

larger, anterior end of the shell. Frequently, they are broken or torn off in 
the searchings through the sand but are soon regenerated. This accounts 
for the difference in length of the captacula in many specimens. 

The embryonic shell or prodissoconch of the scaphopods is cup-shaped 
and consists of two shelly valves, which subsequently unite to form a tube. 
They may still be seen at the initial end in some specimens of Siphonoden- 
talium, but are always absent in adult Dentalium. The adult shell is open 
at both ends. It is added to at the larger, anterior end by the mantle edge, 
while at the posterior end there may be a gradual loss of shell through wear 
and absorption. The tiny posterior slits or notches that are characteristic 
of some species are formed by reabsorption of the previously solid shell 
wall. The shell wall is made up of three thin layers of calcareous material; this 
is in contrast to the similar-appearing worm-tubes that have only two layers. 
In cross-section, the shell may be round, slightly elliptical, octagonal or 
polygonal in shape, depending upon the species. The presence or absence of 



Lives of the Other Mollusks 55 

microscopic longitudinal or concentric riblets and the nature of the apical 
slits are often useful for identification. Few of our American species, other 
than a few pinkish or yellowish forms, can boast of colorful shells; but in 
the East Indies such forms as Dentaliwn elephantinum Linne are brightly 
hued in various shades of emerald green and jade. Some species of Dentalium 
have a terminal pipe projecting out of the posterior end. 

There are only two families in the class Scaphopoda — the Dentaliidae 
and the Siphono dentaliidae. Both families are well-represented in our waters, 
the former by numerous species of Dentaliimt, the latter by members of the 
genus Cadulus. 

Dentaliidae: Shell tusk-shaped, increasing in size regularly with the greatest 
diameter at the mouth end. Foot conical. Central tooth of radula twice 
as wide as long. 

Siphonodentaliidae: Shell bulbous near the middle with the mouth end 
generally contracted. Foot vermiform, capable of expansion into a 
rosette-like disk at the end. Central tooth of radula almost square. 



CHAPTER V 



Collecting 
American Seashells 



Instructions for collecting seashells are much akin to revelations of the 
secrets of good cooking. Everyone has his favorite methods and, despite 
the most expert advice one may obtain from books, experience is the surest 
path to success. There are, however, a number of fundamentals which will 
help guide the collector in obtaining a representative series of our seashells 
with the least trouble. The hints offered here are more in the order of how 
collecting problems may be solved than a revelation of how and where to 
find rare specimens. 

The most successful collectors mix together four ingredients to obtain 
what appears to most of us "unusual luck" in finding good shells. These 
are a knowledge of the habits of mollusks, a familiarization with the physical 
conditions of the ocean and the seashore, a sensible choice of collecting equip- 
ment and, perhaps most important, a large proportion of perseverance. The 
first three of these may be acquired, to some degree at least, from books and 
from the advice of veteran collectors, but only keen observation in the field 
and many hours of trial collecting will develop satisfactory techniques. It 
is true, of course, that strolling the more productive beaches at certain times 
of year will produce encouraging results, but soon the common species have 
been collected and more often than not the remaining specimens are far 
from perfect. The moment a collector ceases to be a beachcomber and begins 
to search for living mollusks in their natural haunts he has opened unlimited 
possibilities of acquiring a remarkably beautiful and complete collection. 

56 



Collecting American Seashells SI 

It is most surprising how many treasures within arm's reach are lost to 
the uninitiated. A waterlogged board if kicked aside may be found to con- 
tain three or four kinds of interesting wood-boring clams; a rock unturned 
at the end of the beach may still shelter a pair of cowries or a nest of orange- 
tentacled Lima Clams; or the seafan momentarily admired and cast aside may 
be the holdfast for a colony of rare, purple Simnia snails. All mollusks have 
their particular ecological niches or favorite haunts, whether a very limited 
type of locality or more extensive areas such as mud flats, rocky shores or 
the open ocean. To be forearmed with a knowledge of where our species 
live will often bring rich rewards from salt marshes, eel-grass flats, mangrove 
trees, the backs of other marine creatures, the underside of boats or even the 
stomachs of fish. The tracks made by gastropods on sand or mud bottoms 
are characteristic for many species and can aid in hunting down live speci- 
mens. So, too, holes of certain shapes and sizes in the sand flat are a betrayal 
of the clam occupant deep below. At times it is worthwhile to know when 
and where gregarious mollusks gather to breed. Their appearance is often 
clocked not only by the seasons but often bv tidal conditions and the time 
of day. Most intertidal species reveal themselves more frequently about half 
an hour after the tide has begun to rise. A great number of species are more 
active a few hours after dark, while others are content to wait until early 
morning before starting on their foraging missions. 

Attention to tides, seasonal moods of the ocean and the effects of winds 
and currents is put to good use by the expert collectors. September seems to 
be the most favorable time, for instance, to gather shells on the Carolina 
strands. During late April and early May there is more likelihood of the 
Purple Sea Snail, JajJtbma, being washed ashore on the east coast of Florida. 
After winter gales, some New England beaches may be strewn with millions 
of large Surf Clams, Spisida. 

Low tide is obviously the best time to collect, and most collectors make 
long-range plans to catch the spring tides. Local newspapers publish the 
times of low and high tides, but many serious collectors prefer to use the 
Coast and Geodetic Survey Tide Tables to plan well in advance for the lowest 
tide of the month. Tide Tables for the Pacific and Atlantic coasts may be 
obtained for a fraction of a dollar from the U.S. Department of Commerce, 
Washington 25, D.C. 

As you may well know, the rise and fall of tides are caused by the at- 
traction of the moon, and to a lesser extent by the sun. Choose the time 
of the new and full moon for collecting, for that is when the sun and moon 
are uniting their forces to give the lowest or spring tides. Low tide lasts 
for about fifteen minutes, but profitable collecting may be done one hour be- 
fore or after. It is sometimes useful to know that the tides are about fifty 
minutes later the following day. Be aware of the dangers of rising tides, 



58 American Seashells 

especially if you have waded a long distance out to some small isle at low 
tide. Tidal currents can sometimes be extremely strong at the narrow mouths 
of inlets, and swimmers are urged to familiarize themselves with local condi- 
tions. 

If one were to take into the field the collecting equipment which has 
been recommended by friends and books, one would certainly resemble 
a busy Christmas shopper in full knightly armor. Crowbars, bilge pumps, 
shovels, rakes, sets of screens, hammer and chisels, even water wings and 
miner's caps have been suggested. It is true that these and many other pieces 
of equipment are ideal for very specific and limited purposes, but for general 
collecting simplicity and lightness of gear are most essential. If at a later 
date you wish to collect a certain species which lives in rocks, take along that 
hammer and chisel. 

Streamlined collecting in the intertidal areas when it is calm calls for 
little more than a pair of canvas shoes, bathing suit and a few small cloth 
bags. Wear shirt and pants if the sun is bright and your tan still under- 
developed. Two or three cotton bags may be tucked under the belt until 
ready for use. Most shells may be picked up by hand, and the more fragile 
ones put in matchboxes or thumb-sized vials. When a breeze is blowing 
wrinkles on the surface of the water, it is impossible to see the bottom, and 
many collectors use a glass-bottomed bucket or merely a diving mask floated 
on the surface to clear a view. A square or oblong bucket about a foot each 
way and ten or twelve inches high may be made of light wood and the 
glass set in the bottom and held in place with a thin layer of white lead and 
strips of molding or quarter-rounds. If the inside is painted dull black reflec- 
tions on the glass will be held to a minimum. For a clearer view wet the 
inside of the glass occasionally. The water bucket is useful to those who 
enjoy diving for shells. It not only serves as a friendly support between 
dives, but may be used as a collecting receptacle. Diving masks or water 
goggles are indispensible for collecting many species which are normally 
found in waters down to twenty feet in depth. 

A fine-mesh wire screen bought in any kitchen utensil store can be put 
to excellent use in sandy or muddy areas where many interesting small shells 
live. Screening for mollusks is a favorite pastime with many collectors, and 
many types and sizes of screens have been designed. Copper mesh should be 
used if you plan to screen over a period of a few months. 

Forceps are sometimes useful in getting small shells out of rock crevices, 
but in general it does not pay to search individually for minute shells. Mass 
screening or taking a large bagful of bay bottom or beach drift home for 
leisurely sorting in the evenings brinos richer rewards. Shaking clumps of 
seaweed over the screen often gives encouraging results, for many uncommon 



Collecting A7nerican Seashells 59 

species are found nowhere else. Breaking apart coral blocks often reveals 
interesting rock-boring clams. 



DREDGING AND TRAPPING 

There are few active shell collectors who have not given serious thought 
to trying their hand at dredging. This is especially true if one has spent sev- 
eral summers in one locality and acquired a large and representative collec- 
tion of the littoral and intertidal species. Over half of our American species 
prefer to live below the low-tide mark and, although storms occasionally 
cast up samples of this rich fauna on our beaches, trapping and dredging are

the only satisfactory methods of collecting deep-water species. In many 
instances larger and more perfect specimens of normally shallow-water spe- 
cies are found in moderately deep waters just offshore. 

Dredging, like fishing, is a science as M-ell as an art. It requires a basic 
knowledge of boats, equipment and bottom conditions. Firsthand experience 
is a necessity before satisfactory results can be obtained. It is also an expen- 
sive operation in which costs increase geometrically the deeper one dredges. 
Those who are financially willing to spend several hundred dollars in elabo- 
rate operations are urged to seek the advice of one of several of the Florida 
or California shell dredgers. However, very profitable collecting in depths 
less than loo feet may be undertaken from a rowboat at relatively little 
expense. 

One of the prime prerequisites of safe dredging is a healthy respect for 
the ocean and her many moods. Limit rowing operations to calm inlets and 
bays. Sudden squalls, high winds, swift currents and blistering sun on the 
open ocean are serious adversaries to even the "saltiest" fisherman. Prepare 
for each trip with care, and back your operations with a knowledge of local 
tides, currents, the weather and bottom conditions. 

There are many types of dredges, and the larger your boat and engine 
the more elaborate may be your dredge. For rowboat operations the simplest 
type consists of a triangular or rectangular iron frame with a pair of iron 
bridles which are tied together. A fine-meshed fishino- net is sewn to the 

o o 

frame. The free end of the net is not sew^n but merely tied together, so that 
the contents can be removed from the back. A net of this sort is apt to be 
ripped on rough bottom, so that a canvas sleeve or tube open at the back 
end should be sewn to the frame and allowed to cover the outside of the 
net. The Burches of California, renowned for their west coast dredging, 
have had better luck with a triangular dredge and copper screen net. The 
leading edges of these smaller types, which are rarely more than two feet 
across, should be sharp and flare a little in order to dig moderately deep into 
the bottom. 

Very remarkable results over mud bottoms may be obtained by using 
a small trawl. This is a modified dredge whose leading edges are of lead- 
weighted lines. The mouth of the trawl is kept open by a small, slanting 
board at each end. This type has the advantage of not digging up large 
quantities of ooze and mud. 

In waters less than 150 feet in depth, the tow line may be of %" or 
%" manila rope, although the tendency for this to float in deeper waters 
necessitates the use of lead weights placed at intervals along the line. About 
300 feet of line will suffice for hauls not deeper than 100 feet. 

Only through trial and error will you learn the many tricks of dredging. 
The feel of the line will tell you whether the dredcre is cutting^ into mud or 



CollecMg American Seashells 61 

gravel or is skipping over the bottom. Sometimes it is next to impossible to 
dredge downhill, so try in the opposite direction if your dredge is failing to 
dig in. On dredges with iron bridles it is suggested that one arm be attached 
to the frame merely by a small cord, so that it will break loose and free the 
dredge should it snag on rocks or corals. 

When hauls are brought aboard they should be screened and washed 
to remove mud and sand. If this is not convenient, at least the extraneous 
material may be thrown away and the remainder put in sacks for home sort- 
ing. In tropical waters, gloves should be worn to prevent serious stinging by 
certain kinds of sponges. Be sure to make a record of the depth, location 
and date of haul. 

Fish and lobster men often bring up rare shells in their traps, and this 
suggests, of course, the possibility of setting one's own traps. Successful 
traps may be purchased or built M'ith a little ingenuity, if the entrances are 
made so that snails can easily enter. Dead fish or spoiled meat will attract 
the carnivorous gastropods, but to date no magical "catnip" has been found 
to lure the herbivorous species. Even simpler than the trap is the system of 
weighting a burlap bag of spoiled meat with rocks near the low-water line. 
Nassarius Mud Snails, Melongena Crown Shells and a host of other species 
may be collected nearby the next night. 

If you have yet to collect your first live Olive or Terebra shell, wade 
along the shores of a sandy bay on a quiet, moonlight night, and with the 
aid of a flashligrht follow aloncr the trails in the sand. A dozen daytime visits 

CO 

to the same locality will never compare to one hour of night collecting. Not 
only are sand-dwelling mollusks on the move, but in rocky regions the cow- 
ries, mitras and murex shells are out from under their hiding places and 
traveling along in full view. 

It is perhaps appropriate here to mention the dangers of over-collecting 
in certain localities. This is to be avoided particularly if certain species have 
taken several seasons to build up their populations even to a moderate size. 
By leaving at least most of the immature specimens and perhaps one or two 
adults, you will assure yourself of good collecting at the same spot at a later 
date. While it is unreasonable to expect people to roll back the rocks they 
have overturned, some collectors do this in order to obtain additional speci- 
mens on the next visit. Once destroyed by sunlight and air, protective algae 
and sponges need many months to grow back. However, the blame for 
extinction of many beautiful mollusks at Lake Worth, Florida, and in many 
other places rests not with greedy collectors but with super-drainage experi- 
ments, city pollution and construction work. 

Keeping accurate locality data with specimens you have collected is 
most essential. Many private collections are eventually left to museums for 
the enjoyment and use of future generations. Today's crowded museums 



62 American Se ash ells 

must rightfully dispose of specimens which have no data and are therefore 
of no scientific value. Large and beautiful collections representing much 
time and cost would have been of inestimable value to science had someone 
only taken the time to record where each specimen was collected. "Aus- 
tralia," "Hawaii" or "California" is not enough. An example of good data 
would be: "North end of Captiva Island, Lee County, Florida. Leo Burry, 
collector. July 4, 1952." Many careful collectors add interesting notes con- 
cerning the depth of water, type of bottom, abundance, and so forth. A rare 
shell in perfect condition, correctly identified and with accurate data, is 
almost worth its weight in gold. 

PREPARING SHELLS FOR THE COLLECTION 

The beauty and value of a collection depends largely on the manner in 
which specimens are cleaned and the methods in which the shells are arranged 
and housed. The majority of snails and clams, whether they be marine, land 
or fresh-water, may be cleaned of their animal soft parts by merely boiling 
in fresh or salt water for about five minutes. The meat may be extracted 
with a bent safety pin or icepick, depending on the size of the specimen. 
Shells which have a highly glossed or enameled finish, such as the cowries 
and olives, should never be thrown directly into boiling water. Start them 
in warm water, bring slowly to a boil, and then let cool gradually. Any rapid 
change in temperature will crack or check the polished surface. Save the 
horny operculum or trapdoor of those species that have them. When the 
shell is dry, a plug of cotton will hold the operculum in the aperture. 

Many species are difficult to clean even when the boiling system is used. 
Usually the tip end of the animal's body remains in the shell of such genera 
as Terebra, Vasum and Xenophora. Vigorous shaking or syringing with a 
powerful blast of tap water will get most out. Filling the shell half full of 
water and setting it out in the shade for a day or so with an occasional syring- 
ing will help. If odors still persist a few drops of formaldehyde introduced 
into the shells, plus a cotton stopper, will eliminate the objections. 

In the Pacific Islands most collectors bury their shells alive a few inches 
under soft, dry sand. In a few weeks the specimens are dug up and washed. 
The sand must be sifted for smaller shells and the opercula. Some people 
who do not object to flies set their shells upside down in the sand and allow 
blowfly larvae or maggots to clean out the meat in a week or so. Vigorous 
rinsing of the shell is all that is necessary. 

Many delicate snails, including most land species and small fragile clams, 
may be placed in fresh water overnight and then syringed or picked clean. 
This system works well with Dentalium, Janthina, Marginella, OHvella, Trivia 
and Cyphoma, although the last four genera may require a two-day soak. Bi- 



Collecting American Seashells 63 

valves are usually the easiest to boil and clean. Allow your pairs to dry in 
the flat, open or "butterfly" position, as this will permit ready inspection of 
the hinge teeth for identification purposes. 

There are many minute species which obviously cannot be boiled and 
picked clean. Shells less than one third of an inch may be soaked in seventy 
percent grain alcohol, and then placed in the sun to dry thoroughly. This 
strength of alcohol is also ideal for pickling squid, octopus or the soft parts 
of other mollusks. Isopropyl alcohol may be used, but it is best to use this 
at a fifty percent strength. Never use formaldehyde (or formalin) to pre- 
serve mollusks. The shell turns soft, loses color and often crumbles away in 
a few months. 

When a shell has been cleaned of its soft parts, it must next be prepared 
for the collection. Most shells are ready for display and most attractive in 
their natural state. However, a large number of gastropods, whose beauty 
is hidden by coral and algal growths, are in need of a certain amount of "face 
lifting." A stifl" brush, soapy water and diligence will usually suffice. Many 
collectors soak specimens in a strong chlorine solution for a few hours. This 
removes a great part of the unsightly growths and will not damage the shell. 
It will also remove the natural periostracum or thin corneous layer on the 
outside of the shell. However, when you have several specimens to add to 
your collection, it is best to keep at least one in its natural state. 

Very few expert collectors use acid in treating shells, since this often 
gives specimens a very unnatural, although colorful, sheen. It is used occa- 
sionally to remove limy deposits and to brighten up old specimens. Com- 
mercial dealers dip the Pink Queen Conch, for example, for five or ten sec- 
onds in a vat of one part muriatic acid to four parts of water and then rinse 
in fresh water. Shells may be dipped with forceps in full strength oxalic or 
muriatic acid for r^vo seconds and then immediately put under running cold 
water. This may be repeated until the desired effect is obtained, but it should 
be pointed out that any acid treatment ruins most shells for scientific study. 

Polishing abalone shells and cutting cross-sections of larger shells require 
special equipment such as electrically run burring wheels and circular dia- 
mond cutters. A visit to a shell factory will be of profit to those wishing to 
undertake this interesting hobby. 

THE SHELL COLLECTION 

Although seashells are easy to keep since they do not deteriorate and 
generally do not fade in color like many insects, they present many special 
problems in housing because of their many sizes and shapes. There are three 
general types of collections — the knickknack shelf, the display arrangement 
and the study collection.

The first of these is usually the result of a summer's random beach col- 
lecting by the novice or a living-room auxiliary to the mam collection. Many 
important private collections have started in this manner. 

The display collection for museums, libraries, clubs or even the home 
is limited by the pocketbook and by the type of secondhand display cabmets 
that can be afforded. Little more is needed than common sense "tent.on to 
matters of good artificial lighting, attractive but neutral background, neat 
hb Ing choice of specimens and especially the avoidance of overcrowdmg.

One has a wide choice of themes-a selection of local shells, molusks of 
"conomc or medical interest, shells of odd habits, examples of colors and 
pauerns and a host of others. The labels of exhibits showing classification 
should bear the scientific and common names and the geographica range. 
Mtaiature display boxes with cotton background and glass or celbphane 
covering are very popular and, if of uniform size, may be neatly stacked m a 
closet when not in use.

Figure 21. The shell collection. 

The name "study collection" may sound ominous to some but, if a few 
simple principles are followed, this type of housing will bring more ,oy and 
less work than any other system. It is not only neater, more compact and 



Collecting American Seashells 65 

equally as attractive as the display type, but it also permits the collector to 
locate any specimen quickly and add new material with a minimum of rear- 
ranging. The simplicity, uniformity and mobility of equipment, such as 
drawers, trays, labels and vials, and the use of the biological or systematic 
order of arrangement are the essence of a good collection. 

The choice of cabinet and style of drawers will be limited, of course, 
by the collector's pocketbook. The accompanying designs are the result of 
many years of observing private and institutional cabinets, and they are 
offered here as an ideal toward which you can strive. 

If the cabinet is made in a roughly oblong shape and is about table- 
height, additional cabinets may some day be set alongside for desk space or 
set on top of each other without causing the top drawers to be too high to 
reach. Pine, basswood or any of th^ whitewoods may be used. It has been 
reported that certain oaks have a detrimental effect on shells which have 
been stored away for years. It is best to have a cabinet door which swings 
open all the way (i8o degrees), although so hinged that the drawers may 
still be pulled out when it is open only 90 degrees. Some students prefer the 
type of door which lifts off. 

The ideal cabinet unit has the following dimensions: outside measure- 
ments, height 40" (or 80") ^ width 22'', depth 32''. Runners for drawers, 30'' 
long. If wooden, %'' X %" and set 2^4" apart. If galvanized sheet iron, 
2%'' wide and bent along the midline to form an L. Inside measurements, 
wooden drawers 20" X 30" and i%". No runners or handles are necessary 
on the drawers. 

All cardboard trays to hold specimens should be %'' in depth, and all 
their other outside dimensions should be multiples of the smallest type of tray. 
This unit may be iK'" X 2", the next largest tray 3'' X 2", then 3'' X 4", 
then 4/^2'' X 6", and the largest of all 8'' X 9''. It is inadvisable to have more 
than five sizes of trays, since this complicates curating and the making or 
ordering of future stocks. Odd-sized trays make neat arrangement impos- 
sible. Cardboard trays covered with glossv-white enameled paper may be 
purchased in any large city, or a simple style may be made by cutting out 
and folding pieces of shirtboard as shown in our illustration. The corners 
are held together by adhesive paper or butcher's tape. The various sets, or 
lots as they are called, of each species should be placed in the trays and 
arranged in the drawer from left to right, beginning at the front. Many 
students separate the species or genera by turning over an empty box which 
may bear a label indicating the genus or species. 

Small e^lass vials without necks are used to hold smaller specimens. Cot- 
ton is best for plugging the vials, since corks are expensive, are difficult to 
obtain for various-sized vials and eventually deteriorate. When a lot consists 
of a hundred or more small specimens which will not easily go into vials, it is 



66 American Se ash ells 

convenient to use a covered box 3'' X 4'' and 2" deep. The label should be 
pasted on the lower left corner of the lid. A duplicate label or a slip of card 
bearing the catalog number should be placed in the box. Some people can 
afford to have glass-covered boxes. 

A catalog is most essential, and its single purpose is to prevent the loss 
of valuable locality data. If each specimen bears the same number as the 
label and catalog entry, it can be returned to its proper tray in case of acci- 
dental spilling. A thick ledger about 1 2" X 8" may be purchased at a second- 
hand office equipment store at small expense. Headings may be arranged 
across both pages as shown in our figure. More space should be given "Local- 
ity" than any other section. Run your catalog numbers from i on up. Do 
not experiment with mystical letters indicating the locality, collector or date 
of cataloging, since all this information will be on your label and in your 
catalog. A card catalog arranged systematically is useless, time-consuming 
and a duplication of the information already available from your collection. 

Specimens should be numbered in India ink with a fine pen. Shells that 
are too small to number may be put in vials or covered boxes, but do not fail 
to add a small slip bearing the catalog number. 

The housing of molluscan animals, octopus and other soft-bodied crea- 
tures which must be preserved in seventy percent grain alcohol is expensive 
and generally beyond the scope of the average private collector. It may be 
mentioned, however, that preserving jars with rubber rings and clip-on glass 
lids are the best. Vials with necks may be plugged tightly with cotton and 
set upside down in the jars. 

The mollusk collection should be arranged systematically, that is, in 
biological sequence, with the first drawer containing the primitive abalones, 
followed by the limpets and on up to the specialized bubble shells {Bulla). 
The small chiton, cephalopod and scaphopod classes mav be put at the begin- 
ning of the gastropods or between them and the bivalves. You may wish to 
place your unsorted or unidentified material in the last few drawers. Once 
you have a species represented in your collection, do not stop there. Add 
other lots from other collecting regions. You will then learn to appreciate 
individual, ecological and geographical variations. 

Exchanging. An amazing amount of traffic of duplicate material exists 
throughout the country and in many parts of the world today. Exchanging 
is an ideal way of sharing your local rich hauls and of obtaining species be- 
yond your collecting sphere. A list of the many hundreds interested in 
exchanging is published in several directories of conchologists and naturalists. 
Sound out your prospective exchanger to learn what species or type of mate- 
rial he desires, since some advanced collectors are extremely "choosy." Al- 
ways give accurate locality data and send as perfect specimens as you can. 
Some people make up elaborate exchange lists which they send around to 



Collectifig American Seashells 61 

other collectors. Exchanging, although worthwhile, is time-consuming, and 
great care must be taken that the upkeep of your main collection does not 
suffer. 

Excellent specimens with largely reliable locality data may be obtained 
from a number of dealers. Their prices are often high, but this is justified, 
at least with regard to locally dredged material, by the high cost of operating 
boats and replacing dredges. Like antiques and costume jewelry, the prices 
of shells vary with what people will pay. 

Shipping. When sending shells on exchange or to some other collector 
for identification, always include a fully inscribed label with each lot. Most 
shells are best protected by loose wrapping in old newspaper. Small or fragile 
shells should be boxed with cotton. Mail or express shipments up to twenty 
pounds will travel safely in cardboard cartons obtained from the grocery 
store. The top and bottom should be padded with two inches of crumpled 
newspaper. Small lots are conveniently sent in mailing tubes. It is inadvisable 
to send living snails through the mails, and foreign imports of living land and 
fresh-water mollusks are prohibited by law except by prior permission from 
The Surgeon General, U.S. Public Health Service or from The U.S. De- 
partment of Agriculture, Washington 25, D.C. 

Identification services. Besides popular books and a few professional 
papers available in public libraries, there are few places where amateurs may 
turn for expert determinations. Fortunately, not a few private collectors are 
even more familiar with their local faunas than are the professional workers. 
Although some charge small fees for their services, most are only too happy 
to identify your "sticklers." It is customary to name only material which has 
been sorted and which has accurate and detailed locality data, and to send a 
sufficient series so that the identifier may retain a sample for his efforts. It is 
a breach of etiquette to send material before asking if the identifier is willing 
to undertake the task. Sending photographs is highly unreliable and is tanta- 
mount to saying you do not trust the specimens out of your hands. Some 
museums will identify specimens if vou are unable to do so after serious 
effort, and this, of course, can be done only if the curator or research worker 
has the time. Never send more than five species at a time. It is surprising how 
many people abuse this service, purely voluntary on the part of the expert, 
by sending unsorted, data-less shells. It is more important that the profes- 
sional spend his time in caring for his vast collections, doing his research and 
writing^ for the benefit of all, than in identifying for the few. Medical work- 
ers, agriculturalists, archaeologists, fisheries men, ecologists and other profes- 
sional malacologists already demand a great deal of his time.

OUTSTANDING COLLECTIONS 

There are a number of very lovely private collections in the United 
States, some devoted wholly to marine species, others limited to land or 
fresh-water types. Many represent years of collecting, others an expenditure 
of many thousands of dollars. To mention a few would be to slight many 
another. The best private collections are in California, Florida, Connecticut, 
the New York area and Massachusetts. As time passes, private collections 
are either sold, lost or left to some public or university museum, so that today 
we find the largest collections housed by public or endowed institutions. 

The United States National Museum, under the Smithsonian Institution 
in Washington, D.C., contains what is undoubtedly the largest mollusk col- 
lection in the world. Until Dr. Paul Bartsch, now retired, was curator, it 
was second in size to that of the British Museum in London. Today, this 
study collection contains over 9,000,000 specimens, 600,000 lots or suites and 
in the neighborhood of 36,000 species and subspecies. Its curator at present 
is Dr. Harald A. Rehder, and his associates are Dr. J. P. E. Morrison. 

The Museum of Comparative Zoology at Harvard College, Cambridge, 
Massachusetts, has risen to second place in the United States within the last 
fifteen years. It is famous for its well-kept collection of about 7,000,000 
specimens, 300,000 lots and approximately 28,000 species and subspecies. Its 
present curator is Dr. William J. Clench, noted for his development of stu- 
dents in mollusks. Dr. Ruth D. Turner is assistant curator. 

The Academy of Natural Sciences of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, is 
third or fourth in size and contains an unusual amount of valuable material. 
Its present curator. Dr. Henry A. Pilsbry, has been with the institution for 
over sixty years, and he has contributed more to our science than any other 
worker. He was preceded by two equally famous curators, George W. 
Tryon and Thomas Say, America's first malacologist. The author is the 
present incumbent of the Pilsbry Chair of A4alacology. 

In the Midwest, one of our largest fresh-water and land collections is 
located at the Museum of Zoology, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor. 
Dr. Henry van der Schalie, an expert on fresh-water clams, is the curator. 
The Chicago Museum of Natural History in Illinois contains a small but 
adequate collection and is under the care of Dr. Fritz Haas, a scientist well- 
versed in many phases of malacology. 

There are no very large study collections in southeastern United States, 
although one of the finest exhibit collections is on display at Rollins College 
in Winter Park, Florida. It is well worth visiting, for the collection is beau- 
tifully lighted and arranged and is instructively labeled. Of equal brilliance, 
the Simon de Marco collection of rarities is housed in the commercial Florida 
Marine Museum near Fort Myers, Florida. 



Collecting American Se ash ells 69 

Among the leading American collections that in the California Academy 
of Sciences in Golden Gate Park, San Francisco, stands foremost in western 
United States. It is a large and well-kept collection, supplemented by an 
excellent library. Drs. G. Dallas Hanna and Leo Hertlein have in the main 
been responsible for its successful growth. The Paleontology Collection at 
Stanford University contains a large series of recent and fossil mollusks. It 
is particularly strong in material from the Pacific northwest. Its present cura- 
tor. Dr. Myra Keen, is one of our outstanding malacologists who specializes 
in marine bivalves. A very large collection of marine mollusks is housed at 
the San Diego Natural History Society, Balboa Park, San Diego. The 
Museum of Paleontology, University of California, Berkeley, also has a very 
large collection. 



CHAPTER VI 

How to Know 
American Seashells 



The satisfaction of gradually becoming master of a study and the enjoyment 
of devoting a full interest to one of the many fields of natural history, 
whether it be wild flowers, butterflies or seashells, are the two strongest 
motivations among naturalists in their search for new facts and additional 
specimens. "Knowing seashells" is not so much a state of knowledge, attained 
after so many years of study, as it is a continuous process of adding to our 
store of information and experience. Through personal observation, by tak- 
ing advantage of what others have discovered and recorded, and by increas- 
ing our ability to identify species, we gradually become familiar with our 
mollusks. 

Whafs the name of that shell? Is it rare or covnnon? How does it 
live? Where cai2 1 find more and better specimens? These are four of the 
most frequently asked questions among shell collectors. Because people who 
are incurably or only mildly "shell-shocked" are continually asking for the 
names of shells, over three fourths of this book is devoted to the problem of 
recognizing and naming our American seashells. 

To know the name of a shell is in many ways to know the object itself. 
What we may gain in observation of the shell, the animal which builds it or 
the habits of the creature, we can, with its correct name, compare w^th the 
findings made by other students. "So this is Sozon's Cone!" transforms the 
shell in your collection into an object of rarity and opens the door to fasci- 
nating^ accounts of fatal, venomous cone shells or the tales of bygone shell

auctions. If Anachis avara is swarming over an oyster bed, no one takes 
particular note, but the mere mention of the Destructive Oyster Drill, Uro- 
salpinx cinerea, brings the shell-fishery man to the scene to eliminate the pest. 

The identification of one of the 6,000 species found in our waters is not 
always a simple task. True, by flipping through pages of illustrations we 
may spot the shell in question or at least a near relative. This method will 
sometimes bring us close enough so that reference to the text will reveal the 
correct identity. However, unless it is reahzed that many species differ only 
in seemingly slight characters and, conversely, that other species show wide 
variation in color or shape, misidentifications can result. How hopeless a task 
it would be to separate into species the various color varieties of the Common 
Coquina Shell (Donax variabilis) or the many shapes and sculptural varieties 
of the Western Dog Winkle (Thais laiitellosa) . Yet how many would not 
at first fail to notice the differences between the shell of McGinty's Cyphoma 
and the Flamingo Tongue {Cyphoma gibbosa)} But look at the obvious dif- 
ferences in the color patterns of the animals shown on plate 8. 

Marine mollusks are exceedingly responsive to varying ecological con- 
ditions. The presence of certain salts and minerals in the mud often dictates 
the degree to which certain colors are developed or to what extent spines 
are produced. In highly exposed areas, where surf waves pound against the 
shore, snail shells are usually devoid of delicate sculpture. These differences 
caused by environment are often difficult to distinguish from those which 
are genetic or naturally inherent characters of the species. So, too, there is 
often great genetic variation within a species, just as we have brunettes, 
blondes and redheads among humans. It is not an easy problem, even for 
the professional, to define the limits of a species, nor to say with authority 
that a certain specimen represents a "form" or is an example of a subspecies 
or even different species. 

What is a species? Volumes have been written in answer to this ques- 
tion, and the subject is one of continuous investigation by many biologists 
working with all forms of animals and plants. Every population of mollusks 
is inherently different, and these differences, however minute, are morpho- 
logical, physiological or genetic. One need only collect a common species in 
several localities along our coast and carefully examine them in order to reach 
this conclusion. It is this factor of geographical variation, together with 
timely isolation and selection, which has been largely responsible for the 
evolutionary production of species. The development of species is a con- 
tinuous and very gradual process and, when we settle upon a reasonably 
homogeneous series of populations and label them as, say, Melongena corona, 
we are merely "snapping a candid camera shot" of a species living today, one 
whose picture looked quite different several million years ago during the 
Pliocene period. Within the geographical range of this species we find a 



72 American Seashells 

series of populations on the west coast of Florida which seem to be attempt- 
ing a "break-away" from the typical form, and to this geographical race the 
name Melojigena corojia perspectiva has been given. Perhaps in another 
million years, through fortuitous isolation (geographical or reproductive) 
and selection, it will merit recognition as a full species. Elsewhere through- 
out the range of corona, we find minor groups of variants, some that are 
individuals stunted by ecological conditions, others that are minor genetic 
variations which seem to crop up at random in all parts of Florida. These 
ecotypes, aberrations and varieties, although actors in the evolution game, do 
not warrant subspecific names. 

There have been many attempts to define a species. A very excellent 
summary of the various definitions has been published in Ernst Mayr's inter- 
esting book entitled Systematics and the Origin of Species (Columbia Uni- 
versity Press, 1942). Mayr defines species as groups of actually or potentially 
interbreeding natural populations, which are reproductively isolated from 
other such groups by geographical, physiological or ecological barriers. Un- 
fortunately, this biological concept of species cannot as yet be used exten- 
sively in the field of mollusks, for malacology is largely in the purely descrip- 
tive and cataloging stages, and the majority of species being described today 
are still based on the old-fashioned morphological species concept. 

While the species is considered by some people as an objective entity in 
nature, nearly everyone agrees that a genus is merely a convenient and 
arbitrary grouping of closely related species. This is also true of many higher 
categories such as the subfamily and family which are merely convenient 
groupings of closely related genera. However artificial, the system is ex- 
tremely useful, for it permits us to arrange the species in our collections and 
our scientific reports in a logical, evolutionary and biological sequence. 

IDENTIFICATION FEATURES 

These are the many morphological features exhibited in mollusks which 
are used for identifying species and in understanding the evolutionary rela- 
tionships existing between members of the higher categories, such as genera, 
families or orders. It must be realized that in some groups of shells certain 
types of characters, such as number of spines, shape of aperture or color 
markings are used to distinguish species, while in other groups these will 
prove useless and reliance may have to be put on the number of folds in the 
columella, the number of teeth in the aperture or the sculpturing on the 
operculum. These key features are pointed out in their appropriate places 
throughout this book. 

The \'erbal tools which are used in the study of mollusks are especially 
designed to assure a method as accurate as possible for telling apart the

100,000 or more living, and many more fossil, species of moUusks. It is im- 
possible to avoid using technical names for various parts of the shell and its 
animal, such as apex, spire, whorls, operculum, etc., for most of these words 
have no counterpart in everyday language. Familiarization with these few 
terms is gained easily and rapidly as trial identifications and references to the 
illustrated glossaries are made. Many of the technical terms explained below 
are not employed in this book, but they are presented for the sake of those 
readers who intend to use more advanced works. 



Gastropod Features 

Shape of shell. It is this character that is instinctively used at first when 
identifying a snail shell, and little would be gained in discussing at length 
what our photographs so clearly demonstrate. However, the shape of the 
adult shell in some species may differ radically from its young stages as may 
be seen in the illustrations of the cowries (pi. 6g) or the American Pelican 
Foot (Aporj'hais, pi. 23c). Monstrosities caused by embryological defaults 
or by injury in early life have always been a source of error in identification, 
and in certain extreme cases many species have been erroneously described 
as new. 

Parts of the shell. As the typical gastropod mollusk grows, it adds to 
the spiral shell and produces turns or ivhorls. The first few whorls, or nu- 
clear whorls, are generally formed in the tgg of the mollusk and usually 
differ in texture, color and sculpturing from the postnuclear whorls which 
are formed after the animal has hatched. When the nuclear whorls are 
marked off from the remainder of the whorls they are often referred to as 
the protoconch. The last and largest whorl which terminates at the aperture 
of the shell is known as the body ivhorl. The periphery is an imaginary 
spiral area on the outside of the whorl, usually halfway between the suture 
and the base or at a point where the whorl has its greatest width. The Giant 
Atlantic Pyram (pi. 4q) shows a narrow color band on the periphery of the 
last whorl. The w^horl just before the last whorl often has distinctive char- 
acters and has been differentiated by the name penultimate njohorl. Above 
this the succeedingly smaller earlier whorls in the pointed apex of the shell 
are known as apical ^whorls. The rate of expansion of the growing whorls 
and the degree to which the succeeding whorls "drop" determine the shape 
of the shell. The sides of the whorls may be fiat, globose, concave, chan- 
neled or ribbed. The juncture of each whorl against the other forms a suture 
at the top or above the shoulder of each whorl. The suture may be very 
fine — a mere tiny, spiral line — or it may be deeply channeled (see Busy con 
canaliculata, the Channeled Whelk, pi. 2 3n). Sutures may be wavy, irreg- 
ular, slightly or deeply indented or impressed.

IS 



The anterior end of the shell is that end which is in front when the ani- 
mal is crawling. The aperture, the siphonal canal (when present), the head 
and the tentacles of the mollusk are at this end. The posterior end is the 
opposite, where the apex and nuclear whorls are located, hence it is some- 
times referred to as the apical end. When we speak of the posterior side of 
a rib or a bar of color we mean the side nearest to the apex or away from 
the anterior end of the mollusk. The total distance between the two ends 
of the shell is known as the length, although this measurement is often called 
the height.

The aperture of the shell is the hole or space at the end of the body 
whorl into which the mollusk can withdraw itself. The edge of the body 
whorl which borders the aperture is known as the Up (sometimes called the 
peristome in technical works). Sometimes the lip is thickened greatly or flar- 
ing like an old-fashioned blunderbuss. Any startling development of the lip 
is generally a sign of adulthood. If the lip thickens into an unusually large, 
rounded, sharp rib it is known as a varix. Varices may be produced at various 



76 American Seashells 

stages in the growth of a shell, and their number and position are nsed as 
identifying characters (see Bursa, the frog shells, pi. 9k) . 

For the sake of convenience, the part of the lip which is away from the 
center of the shell or is not next to the axis of the shell is known as the outer 
lip. Opposite this on the other side of the aperture is the inner lip or parietal 
wall which may be thickened, armed with teeth (see Nerita, pi. 4) or have 
a parietal shield (see the helmet shells. Cassis, pi. 23V). The inner lip is con- 
tinuous with the thickened axis or colwnella of the shell about which the 
whorls are developed. In many kinds of marine gastropods, especially the 
murexes, the columella extends forward and forms the tube-like anterior 
siphonal canal. In a few genera there is a small posterior ca?jal formed at the 
upper or posterior end of the aperture (see Bursa, pi. 9k). 

The outer lip in a few genera has a very characteristic notch or slit. It 
is longest in the very rare, large Pleurotomaria shell (pi. 3). The "stromboid 
notch" in the conchs is weak but distinct. In the abalones, Haliotis (pi. 2), 
the slit is replaced by a series of small, round anal holes. Nearly all the tur- 
rids are recognized by their "turrid notch" on the upper portion of the outer 
lip. The Keyhole Limpets, Fissurella, have reduced the slit to a single small 
hole which is located at the apex of their cap-shaped shells, although in their 
young stages the slit is well-developed at the edge of the shell (see fig. 5). 

The sculpturing on the exterior of the shell — ribs, nodules, cords, 
threads, indented lines, pits, spines, etc. — are grouped into two basic types: 
( I ) The axial sculpture, that is, any markings, ribs or lines which run across 
the whorl in line with the axis of the shell or from suture to suture. Some- 
times it is called longitudinal sculpture. Varices, growth lines and the outer 
lip are axial features. (2) The spii'al sculpture, which is spirally arranged in 
the direction of the suture or in line with the direction of the growth of the 
whorls. Thus we often speak of spirally arranged color bands (as in the 
Tulip Shell, Fasciolaria hunteria, pi. 13c), or axially arranged color streaks 
(as in the Lightning Whelk, Busy con coiitrarium, pi. 23-0). 

The umbilicus is a hole or chink in the shell next to the base of the 
columella, which is formed because the whorls are not closely wound against 
each other at their anterior or basal end. The umbilicus may be quite large 
and deep as in the sundial shells, Architectonica (pi. 4m). Commonly there 
is a spiral cord in the umbilicus which may terminate in a button-like callus. 
Some species are differentiated by the size, position or color of this znnhilical 
callus (see Polijiices duplicatus, pi. 5k). About a fourth of our marine spe- 
cies are umbilicated to some degree or another. 

Teeth (not to be confused with the radular teeth in the animal's pro- 
boscis or mouth cavity) arc often present in the aperture. The Distorted 
Shell, Distorsio (pi. 25Z), is an extreme example, but some shells have teeth 
on the parietal wall only (Nerita) or on the inside of the outer lip (Cassis).

Tlie periostracu7n is a horny covering which overlays the exterior of 
the shell in many species and, like the shell, is secreted and shaped by the 
fleshy mantle of the animal. The periostracum (erroneously called the epi- 
dermis) may be very thin and transparent or only slightly tinted (as in some 
volutes, moon shells and the smaller conchs); or it may be like a thick coat- 
ing of shellac which flakes off when dry (as in the Queen Conch, Strombus 
gigas). In a few buccinids, some frog shells {Lampusia) and the vase shells 
( Vasimi) , the periostracum may be very thick and often have clumps which 
simulate hairs and bristles. It is wholly absent in many groups, including the 
cowries, olives and marginellas. It is primarily a protective coating and pre- 
vents damage from boring sponges and water acids. 

When axial and spiral sculpturing are equally prominent and cross each 
other at right angles, a cancellate or decussate sculpture is produced. Reticu- 
late sculpture is similar, but the lines do not cross at right angles. 

Growth lines are mentioned in many of our descriptions and these refer 
to the axial lines which run parallel to the edge of the apertural lip. These 
are irregularities in the shell, usually very small but sometimes coarse, which 
mark places where growth of the shell was stopped for a relatively long time. 
Sometimes the lip of the aperture becomes stained or slightly thickened dur- 
ing these brief rest periods (probably a few days apart), and, when addi- 
tional growth takes place, these blemishes are left as growth lines.

The operczilimt is a homy or calcareous plate firmly attached to the 
dorsal side of the posterior end of the foot. When the head and foot are 
withdrawn into the shell, this "trapdoor" is the last part to be pulled in, and 
it thus serves as a protection against enemies and, in many species, seals the 
shell from either noxious fluids or the drying effects of the sun and air. When 
the foot is extended and used in crawling, the operculum serves as a foot-pad 
on which the heavy shell may rest and rub without injury to the soft foot. 
The operculum is present in many families of marine mollusks, and it often 



78 American Seas he lis 

serves as a useful identification character. It is absent in adults in the follow- 
ing families: Marginellidae, Cypraeidae, Tonnidae, Haliotidae, Ac77meidae, 
Fissurellidae, Janthifiidae, and nearly all of the sea slugs (opisthobranchiates, 
nudibranchs, bullas, etc.). Some genera lack this organ, such as Oliva and 
Cypraecassis, although their close relatives, Olivella, Ancilla, Phalium and 
Cassis possess well-developed opercula. Nearly all Valuta are without the 
operculum, except our West Indian Music Volute. This is also true of the 
genera Conns and Mitra whose various species may or may not possess one. 
In the Alaskan volute, V olutharpa ampuUacea Dall, 1 5 percent have an oper- 
culum, 10 percent only traces of the operculigenous area and 75 percent 
without a trace of either. The presence or absence of this part of the animal 
is not always a good classificational character. 

Many families, genera and species (although not in so many cases as 
generally believed) possess a characteristic type of operculum. Calcareous 
or hard, shelly opercula are found in the turban shells ("cat's eyes" of 
Turbo), the rissoids, the nerites, and the natica moon shells. The color and 
sculpturing of these opercula are used for identification purposes. The liotias 
(Liotiidae) possess a horny operculum which is overlaid by rows of calca- 
reous beads. Among the horny or corneous opercula there are several im- 
portant and characteristic tvpes which we have illustrated in figure 24. 

The radula. The minute teeth or radula (also called the odontophore 
or lingual ribbon) located in the mouths of all classes of mollusks, except the 
clams, are so very distinctive in the various families, genera and species that 
they have been used as a fairly reliable identification criterion. Our present 
arrangement of the gastropod families is based largely upon the radula, al- 
though many other anatomical characters of the animal and shell are equally 
important. The Greek naturalist, Aristotle, mentioned the radula of snails as 
early as 350 B.C., but a fuller account was given by the Dutch naturalist, 
Swammerdam, in the seventeenth century. The Italian malacologist, Poli, 
was the first to figure the radulae of gastropods, cephalopods and chitons. 

The radula is attached to the floor of the buccal cavity or inner mouth 
and consists of a ribbon-shaped membrane to which are attached many small, 
fairly hard teeth. The radula ribbon is maneuvered back and forth in some- 
what licking fashion as the animal rasps its food. The teeth are arranged in 
transverse rows on the ribbon (see fig. 6), The number of rows may vary 
from a dozen (in some nudibranchs) to several hundred. Each transverse 
row contains a specific number of teeth, depending on the family or group 
to which the snail belongs. In the taenioglossate snails (many families, includ- 
ing Cypraeidae, Strovihidae, Cerithiidae and Littoriuidae) tliere are generally 
only seven teeth in each row, but each of these teeth has a distinctive shape 
and a specific number of tiny cusps on its edges. The tooth in the center is 
called the rachidian or central. Flanking this tooth on each side is a lateral. 



How to Knouo American Seas hells 



79 



Beyond each lateral there is first an inner marginal and finally an outer mar- 
ginal. This makes seven teeth in all. In the rachiglossate snails {Muricidae, 
Buccinidae, Olividae, etc.) there are only three teeth per row — the rachidian 
and a strongly cusped lateral on each side. The four toxoglossate families 
(Conidae, Turridae, Terebridae and Cancellariidae) have lost their rachidians 
and laterals and have retained only the marginals. 

The docoglossate snails {Acmaeidae and Patellidae) have less than 
twelve teeth per row but are peculiar in that there are two to four identical 
rachidians or centrals. In the rhipidoglossate famihes {Trochidae, Fissurel- 
lidae, Neritidae) the radula is very complicated, and the very numerous lat- 
erals at the end of each row are called uncini. Among the gastropods which 
do not have a radula are the Pyramidellidae, Eidijnidae, the genus Corallio- 
phila, adult Harpa and a few genera of nudibranchs.

We have figured several main types of gastropod radulae (fig. 25), but 
other examples have been included in the systematic section when they are 
of especial use in identification. It is not expected that many amateurs will 
want to prepare and examine radulae but, because so many serious private 
collectors and many biology students will find this identification tool indis- 
pensable, we have included brief instructions on the preparation of radula 
slides. 

Preparation of the radida. In large specimens, such as the whelks or 
conchs, the proboscis may be slit open from above and the round buccal 
mass removed. Occasionally, the proboscis is withdrawn far inside the ani- 
mal, but it is easily located below the thin skin on the dorsum just posterior 
to the tentacles. The flesh may be torn away with the aid of small dissecting 
needles until the glistening, worm-like radula pops out. In order to remove

the last traces of flesh, the radula may be soaked in a saturated solution of 
potassium hydroxide (KOH) for a few minutes. A solution of common lye 
will do as well. Animals whose flesh has been hardened by a preservative will 
have to be carefully boiled for a few minutes or soaked overnight in KOH 
or lye. Small specimens may be dropped whole into this alkaline solution 
if only the radula is desired. Transfer the radula successively to several 
watch-glasses of clean water in order to rid it of all traces of KOH. The 
radula may then be placed in one or two drops of water on a clean, glass 
microscope slide and, by observation under the dissecting microscope, a few 
teeth may be teased apart with fine needles. Leave some of the ribbon intact 
to show the relative position of the teeth. Add a square cover slip for study 
under the compound microscope. In w^ater mounts such as these, stains are 
usually unnecessary. This temporary preparation may be permitted to dry 
for a day, the cover slip gently lifted, a few drops of euporol or mounting 
medium added, and the cover slip replaced to make a permanent shde. Some 
workers prefer to go from water to eosin stain to ninety-six percent alcohol 
and then to euporol, but this is an unnecessary elaboration. There are also 
excellent, permanent, plastic mounting mediums on the market. Canada bal- 
sam and glycerine jelly eventually deteriorate. Keep in mind that KOH or 
lye will burn flesh and eat holes in clothing. 

Pelecypod Features 

Shape of shell. In most families of bivalves, the shape of the shell is 
extremely important as a species character, and only in a few groups, such 
as the oysters and mussels, is shape so variable within a species as to be of 
little taxonomic value. Shape of shell, as a whole, is of little value in deter- 
mining families or genera, except in a few instances such as Pecten, Spon- 
dylus and Pinna. 

Parts of the shell. The two valves of a clam are bound together by a 
brown, chitinous ligament, and usually hooked together by a hinge which is 
furnished with interlocking teeth. The valves are kept closed by powerful, 
internal adductor muscles but kept spread open by the action of the liga- 
ment when the animal relaxes or after it is dead. Each valve is a shallow, 
hollov/ cone, with the apex, from which point growth of the valves com- 
mences, turned to one side. This apex is termed the umbo (plural: umbos, 
umbones) or beak. The hinge and its teeth are usually just below the beak 
on the inside of the valve. The prodissoconch is the embryonic shell of the 
bivalve, and corresponds to the protoconch or nucleus of the gastropods. It 
is generally eroded away in adults, but when preserved it serves as a useful 
identification character, especially in such groups as the oysters. 

Right and left valves. It is important to distinguish one valve from the 



82 



Aifierican Seashells 



other and to determine which is the anterior or posterior end, for many 
identification features are used in relation to these orientations. The dorsal 
or upper inargin is located on the beak or hinge side; the ventral margin is 
the opposite side. The beaks usually are pointed or curved toward the ante- 
rior end which is generally the less pointed end of the shell. The ligament 
in the great majority of cases is posterior to the beaks. When present, the 
heart-shaped impression called the lunule is anterior to the beaks. When a 
clam is placed on its ventral margins on the table with the dorsal hinge mar- 
gin up, and with the anterior end away from the observer, the right valve is 
on the right, the left valve to the left. Another quick way is to observe the 
concave, interior of a valve with the hinge margin away from the observer 
and to locate the U-shaped pallial sinus impression (see below). If the sinus 
opens toward the left, it is a left valve, and vice versa for the right valve.

In most bivalves, the two valves are of the same size (equivahe), but in 
some genera one valve is larger and slightly overlaps the other (ineqjiivalve) . 
In Ostrea, Pandora and Lyonsia, the left valve is the larger; in Corbula, the 
right valve is the larger. A bivalve is said to be equilateral when the beak is 
midway between the anterior and posterior ends of the valve. Most bivalves, 
however, are inequilateral with the beak placed nearer one end. 

In many forms, the margins of the valves do not fit closely together, but 
have an opening called the gape somewhere along the margin. In the Soft- 
shelled Clam, My a, the gape is posterior ■and through it protrudes the siphon 
(siphonal gape); in Rocellaria it is anterior and large and serves for the

passage of the foot. Some clams, such as Soleii and Eiisis, gape at both ends. 
In Ar€a there is a small notch or opening on the ventral margin for the 
passage of the anchoring organ, the byssus. This is called the byssal notch. 

The ligament is a brown, horny band located above the hinge, and is 
generally posterior to the beaks. As a rule, the greater part of the ligament 
is externally placed on the shell, but in some genera it may be partially or 
entirely internal. The ligament consists of two distinct parts, which may 
occur together in the same species or separately in others — the ligament 
proper and the internal cartilage or resilmm. In most cases, the two portions 
are intimately connected with one another, but in some clams, such as My a 
and Mactra, the cartilage is entirely separate (the resilium) and is lodged 
within the hinge in a spoon-shaped chojidrophore. The external ligament is 
inelastic and insoluble in strong alkali (KOH). The cartilage is very elastic, 
slightly iridescent and soluble in KOH.

possesses a number of useful identification features. The large muscles which 
serve to close the valves leave round impressions on the surface. When two 
muscles are present, as in the venus, lucine, tellin and other clams, they are 
known as the anterior and posterior muscle scars respectively. The fine, 
single-lined impression produced by the muscular edge of the mantle is 
known as the pallial line. The pallial line may have a U-shaped notch at 
the posterior end of the valve indicating the presence of a siphon and its 
siphonal muscles. This is known as the pallial sinus. It is entirely absent in 
genera possessing no retractile siphons. 

The hinge. This is one of the most important identification features 
in the bivalves, and often many hours of fruitless search can be avoided 
when the major types of hinges and their various parts are understood. 
There are many types of hinges from those without teeth {edentulous) to 
those with a complex pattern. We have figured below some of the major 
types of hinges. The teeth are distinguished as cardinals, or those imme- 
diately below the umbo, and the laterals, or those on either side of the cardi- 
nals. In many inequilateral bivalves the teeth have become so distorted or 
set out of place that it is often difficult to distinguish the cardinals from the 
laterals or to determine which ones are absent. We have labeled the teeth 
in several groups in the systematic section of this book to overcome this 
difficulty. In Chanm, for instance, the cardinals have been pushed up into 
the umbo and have become a mere ridge, while the strong anterior lateral 
has become nearly central and simulates a cardinal. 

Sculpture. In many groups, such as the scallops (Pecten), sculpture is 
of paramount importance in determining species. In most other groups it is 
used in conjunction with other characters. There are two major types of 
sculpture — concentric and radial — and both of these may be present in many 
forms, such as ridges, ribs, nodules, spines, foliaceous processes (leaf-like), 
threads, beads, indented striae (fine lines), etc. Concentric growth lines of 
varying degree of development are seen on most bivalves. They are always 
parallel to the margins of the valves, may be exceedingly fine or very coarse, 
and they generally indicate former growth and resting stages. Radial sculp- 
ture, running from the umbones to the lower or end margins of the valves, 
is exemplified in the ribs of Cardium (pi. 32), Pectejj (pi. 33) and others. 
Concentric and radial sculpture may occur together to form a cancellate 
sculpture as in Chione cancellata (pi. 39h). In a few genera, such as Foro- 
mya, the valve's surface may be granulose, as if finely sugar-coated. 

The periostracum or protective chitinous sheath overlaying the exterior 
of the valves is present in most bivalves. It may be extremely thin and trans- 
parent so that it imparts a high gloss to the shell, or it may be thick and 
matted or even very coarse and stringy so that the valves appear to be 
bearded, as in Volsella and Area.

NAMES AND NOMENCLATURE 

In order to discuss the various kinds of moUusks, we must use stand- 
ardized names which are understood or recognized by students in every part 
of the world. For this reason, Latin names, or latinized forms, are employed 
as the official medium for nomenclature. It is not at all necessary to have a 
knowledge of Latin or Greek in order to label a seashell. Nor is it supposed 
that one should attempt to remember the names, although it adds to the 
enjoyment of the study to absorb those of a few commoner species. In fact, 
it is not difficult to remember such scientific names as Venus, Mitra, Oliva 
and Conus. It may be of interest to beginners to know that few professional 
malacologists can remember more than a hundredth part of the total number 
of names. They, too, consult books to refresh their memories. 

Popular va?nes. Popular or vernacular names in seashells are in great 
need of standardization and, while their use sometimes has its drawbacks, 
there is no reason they cannot become as acceptable to the amateur as have 
the popular names of birds, fishes and wild flowers. It is true that one species 
may be known by one name in New England and another in Florida, but 
these are generally names which are in use by local fishermen and not neces- 
sarily accepted by amateur shell collectors. In the face of so much name 
changing in the scientific literature because of legalistic technicalities, the 
existence of a few provincial popular names seems little enough excuse for 
not attempting to standardize the common names of seashells. Throughout 
this book we have presented both scientific and popular names. The latter 
have been derived from several sources and listed only after careful con- 
sideration of the evidence. Private collectors, shell dealers, professionals and, 
in some cases, many popular books, both recent and old, have contributed to 
the final choice. In a few instances, alternate popular names which are well- 
entrenched along wide regions of our coast have been listed. Popularization 
of patronymic names, such as Clark's cone for Conus clarki, has been simple. 
Direct translations of the Latin have in many but not all cases been advisable. 
Many obvious direct translations have been avoided in order to avoid con- 
fusion with names already used for shells in other regions of the world. It is 
interesting to note that many popular names in use today were recorded by 
early eighteenth century writers, and that a few popular generic names are 
to be found in the writings of Aristotle and Pliny. We have not, of course, 
employed the rule of using the name first employed as is done in scientific 
nomenclature (rule of priority). It is hoped that this first listing of iioo 
popular names of American seashells will bring fuller enjoyment to the many 
amateurs who do not desire to "wrestle" with scientific names. 

Scientific names. A mollusk is given two parts to its scientific name — 
the genus, which is akin to a surname, such as Smith or Jones, and the species 



86 American Sea shells 

which is akin to a first name such as William or Julia. The generic name 
is always capitalized, e.g., Comis, Strombiis or Area, but the specific name 
which comes after the genus name is not, e.g., princeps, pilsh'yi or florideijsis. 
It is also customary to add the name of the person who described and 
christened the species; thus the Queen Conch of southern Florida and the 
West Indies is known as Strovibiis gigas Linne. If subspecies or geographical 
races are recognized, the name may appear, for example, as Melojtgena corona 
perspectiva Pilsbry or M. corona corona Gmelin, the latter being the typical 
race. W'e have employed subgenera throughout the book as center headings. 
They may also be written into the name in parentheses: Janthina (Violetta) 
gJobosa Swainson. It is wrong to put a generic synonym in the middle of 
the name, as Busy con {Fiilgiir) carica Gmelin. 

Some authorities may put the author's name in parentheses, for example, 
Modulus modulus (Linne). This means that the species was first described 
under another genus, in this case, not Modulus but Trochus. Unfortunately, 
as our science becomes more advanced, parentheses must be used in the ma- 
jority of the species, and their usefulness becomes offset by the tax on one's 
memory as to whether or not they are to be employed in the various species. 
Modern workers are attempting to abandon this useless frill of nomencla- 
ture, and in this book they are not used. Dates following the author's names 
refer to the date of publication and serve the useful purpose of tracking 
down the original reference. It should be noted that the "double i" ending 
is no longer used in species names (not smithii, but smkhi). 

Name changing. There is nothing more annoying than having a well- 
known and frequently used scientific name changed; and the field of mol- 
lusks seems to be having its lion's share of tossing out of old friends for utter 
strangers. There are two basic kinds of changes — zoological and nomencla- 
rorial. Everyone will condone the former, for it is obvious, as our knowledge 
increases, that certain genera or even species will be found to be mixtures, 
and this necessitates separating and applying new names. In this book, for 
example, Fasciolaria gigantea is changed to Pleuroploca gigantea. The Horse 
Conch, P. gigantea, does not have characters like those of the tulip shells, 
and it cannot be put in the genus Fasciolaria with such species as F. tulipa 
Linne and F. hunteria Perry. For the same reason, what has been called by 
many workers Ostrea virginica is now Crassostrea virginica. Venus merce- 
naria is now Mercenaria mercenaria. 

Nomenclatorial name changing is hardest for everyone to accept. As 
not infrequently happens, a species may be given several different names 
inadvertently by various authors. The International Commission for Zoolog- 
ical Nomenclature has set up an extensive set of rules; among these is the 
rule of priority by which the earliest valid name is chosen if several names 
are available. Unfortunately, the earliest name may have been overlooked 



How to K?iow American Seashells 87 

for many years, and its subsequent discovery will "knock out" one which 
has been in use for a long time. Thus about thirty years ago the whelk 
genus Fiilgur Lamarck 1799 was abandoned for Busycojt Roding 1798. The 
same fate may be met by well-known species. Thus Busy con pyruin Dillwyn 
1817 now becomes B. spirata Lamarck 181 6. It is believed that "rock bot- 
tom" will be reached some day, so that few, if any, further changes will 
occur. Nevertheless, it is with considerable regret that I change a number 
of familiar names in this book. 

Occasionally, certain names are conserved or "frozen" by the Com- 
mission if they are well-established and are in danger of being replaced by 
an earlier but obscurely known name. The following marine genera of 
mollusks are on the conserved list: Aplysia, Area, Argonauta, Buccinum, 
Bulla, Calyptraea, Cohnnbella, Dentalhnn, Mactra, Modiolus, Mya, Alytihis, 
Neritina, Ostrea, Sepia, Spirula, Teredo. Many others, including very 
familiar species names, need to be added to this list. There are many tech- 
nical refinements to nomenclature, and those interested in such matters are 
referred to Procedure in Taxonomy by Schenk and McMasters (Stanford 
University Press). 

Pronunciatioji of scientific names. There is no official pronunciation 
established for names, and for certain words it may vary from one county 
to another. Many pronunciations not based on classical rules have become 
established and passed on from generation to generation. A few examples, 
classical or not, are given below: 

Oliva (all-eeva), EuJima (you-lee-mah), Chiton (kite-on), Chama 
(kam-ah), Chione (kigh-own-ee), Cypraea (sip-ree-ah), Cyphoma (sigh- 
fo-mah), versicolor (ver-sik-o-lor said quickly). Busy con (boos-eekon), 
]anthina (yan-theena), Xenophora (zen-off-fora), gigas (rhymes with "jibe 
gas": )i-gas), conch (konk), radula (rad-you-lah), operciihim (oh-perk- 
you-lum), smithi (smith-eye), ruthae (rooth-ee). The pronunciations of 
some of the authors are: Linne (lin-ay) or sometimes Linnaeus (lin-ee-us), 
Gould (goold), Deshayes (desh-ayz), Orbigny (or-bee-nee), Gmelin (mell- 
an), Bruguiere (broo-gui-air), Kiener (keen-er), Mighels (my-els), Cou- 
thouy (koo-thoo-ee). 

Cominon abbreviations of names of ivell-known authors. Although 
most popular and scientific books spell in full the names of authors of sci- 
entific designations, a large number of articles and most museum labels bear 
only abbreviations. For this reason, a short list of frequently seen examples 
is included:

Guide to the 
American Seashells 

[ Systefnatic Account ] 



THE SYSTEMATIC ACCOUNT OF THE AMERICAN SEASHELLS 

includes the scientific mid common names, geographical ranges, descriptions, 
comparative remarks and habitats of i ^oo of the 6000 species of marine mol- 
lusks found in North A^nerican waters. The areas covered are from Alaska 
to southern California and from Labrador to the Gulf of Mexico. Conse- 
quently a large part of the molluscan fauna of Bermuda, the West Indies, 
Lower California and the Gulf of California is included. Monographic 
accounts and more detailed information oji the remaining species and their 
ecology, anatomy and habits may be found by consulting the papers 
listed by subject niatter in the appendix on molluscan literature.

Family SCISSURELLIDAE 

Genus Scissurella Orbigny 1823 

Subgenus Schizotrochus Monterosato 1884 

Scissurella crispata Fleming Crispate Slit-shell 

Massachusetts to eastern Florida and the West Indies. Europe. 

3.5 mm. (Vs inch) in width and 3.0 mm. in length. 4 to 5 whorls. Fragile, 
frosty-white in color and sculptured by very delicate reticulations. Umbihcus 
small, round and very deep. Periphery of whorls angulate and with two 
thin, sharp spiral lamellae. Between these there is an open 
slit running from the edge of the thin apertural lip back 
about % of a whorl. Uncommon from 60 to 500 fathoms. 

The Florida Slit-shell, 5. proxivm Dall (fig. 29), from 
South Carolina to the Lower Florida Keys, differs in being 
half as large, with a more rounded periphery, and a higher 
spire, so that the length is about equal to the width of the 
shell, and in having a weaker pair of peripheral lamellae. 
Uncommon from 20 to 434 fathoms.

Gulf of Mexico and the West Indies. 

1/4 to 2 inches in length and width. Umbilicus sealed over. Sculpture 
of finely beaded, small spiral threads. Characterized by a relatively short but 
wide slit at the periphery of the body whorl just behind the outer lip. Color 
dull orange-yellow with darker maculations. Base white. Interior slightly 
pearly. Dredged from 73 to 130 fathoms. One of our rarest seashells. 

Subgenus Entemnotrochus P. Fischer 1885

Plate 3d 

Cuba and the Lesser Antilles. 

3 inches in length, and slightly more in width. Umbilicus round, very 
deep. Sculpture of coarsely beaded, moderately small spiral threads. Slit on 
periphery of whorl narrow and very long ( ^ of a whorl) . Color cream with 
a salmon blush and irregular, small patches of red. Base similarly colored. 
Dredged from 94 to 100 fathoms, but sometimes brought up in fish traps. 
This is an exceedingly rare species. 

Family HALIOTIDAE 
Genus Haliotis Linne 1758 

Haliotis cracherodi Leach Black Abalone 

Plate zf 

Coos Bay, Oregon, to Lower California. 

6 inches in length, oval, and fairly deep. Outer surface smoothish, ex- 
cept for coarse growth lines. Usually 5 to 8 holes are open. External color 
bluish to greenish black. Interior pearly-white. A fairly abundant, edible 
species although not fished commercially to any great extent. A littoral spe- 
cies which clings to rocks between tide marks. Some shells may lack the 
holes (unnecessarily named H. c. holzneri Hemphill, H. c. imperforata Dall 
and H. c. lusus Finlay). A subspecies, H. c. calif orniensis Swainson, occurs 
on Guadalupe Island and is characterized by 1 2 to 16 very small holes. H. c. 
bonita Orcutt is the same as this subspecies. H. c. splendidula Williamson is 
the typical cracherodi. 

Haliotis rufescens Swainson Red Abalone 

Plate 2 a 

Northern California to Lower California. 

10 to 12 inches in length, oval, rather flattened. Outer surface rather 
rough, dull brick-red with a narrow red border around the edge of the shell. 
Interior iridescent blues and greens, with a large central muscle scar. 3 to 4 



HALIOTIDAE 93 

holes are open. Fished commercially below 20 feet, especially between Mon- 
terey and Point Conception. The legal minimum size for sportsmen is 7 
inches, and the catch is limited to 5 specimens per person per day. This is 
a popular food and, when polished on the outside, makes an attractive mantel 
piece. 

Haliotis corrugata Gray Pink Abalone 

Plate 2C 

Monterey, California, to Lower California. 

5 to 7 inches in length, almost round, fairly deep, with a scalloped edge 
and strong corrugations on the outer surface. 3 to 4 large tubular holes are 
open. Exterior dull-green to reddish brown. Interior brilliant iridescent. The 
variety diegoensis Orcutt is the same. Abundant in its southern range. The 
legal minimum collecting size is 6 inches. 

Haliotis fulgens Philippi Green Abalone 

Plate 2b 

Farallon Islands, California, to the Gulf of California. 

7 to 8 inches in length, almost round, moderately deep, and sculptured 
with 30 or 40 raised, coarse spiral threads. Exterior dull reddish brown; 
interior iridescent blues and greens. 5 to 6 holes are open. Fished commer- 
cially in southern California. The legal minimum size is 6^ inches. H. 
splendens Reeve, H. revea Bartsch, and H. turveri Bartsch are the same spe- 
cies in all likelihood. 

Haliotis walallefisis Stearns Northern Green Abalone 

Westport, Washington, to Point Conception, California. 

4 to 5 inches in length, elongate, flattened, with numerous spiral threads. 
Exterior dark brick-red, mottled with pale bluish green. 5 to 6 holes are 
open, and their edges are not elevated. This is a small, relatively scarce 
species. 

Haliotis assimilis Dall Threaded Abalone 

Plate 2d 

Farallon Islands to San Diego, CaHfomia. 

4 to 5 inches in length, oval, fairly deep, with weak corrugations and 
weak to strong spiral threads. 4 to 5 holes open, tubular. Outer color mot- 
tled with brick-red, greenish blue and gray. H. aiilaea Bartsch is a little more 
corrugated than usual, and it may be this species. H. smithsont Bartsch and 
H. sorenseni Bartsch appear to be giant specimens of assimilis Dall.

Haliotis kamtschatkana Jonas Japanese Abalone 

Plate 2e 

Japan, southern Alaska to Point Conception, California. 

4 to 6 inches in length, elongate, with a fairly high spire. 4 to 5 holes 
open which have raised edges. Outside of shell rudely corrugated, but a few 
specimens may have weak, spiral cords. This is a small species, uncommon 
in California, but increasingly abundant northward. 

Haliotis pourtalesi Dall Pourtales' Abalone 

Off the Lower Florida Keys. 

% to I inch in length, elongate, with 22 to 27 wavy, spiral cords. Out- 
side waxy yellow to light-brown with a few irregular patches of reddish 
orange. A light-orange band runs from each hole to the edge of the shell. 
Inside pearly-white. A very rare species, and the only one recorded from our 
eastern coast. It has been dredged from 6^ to 200 fathoms. Beware of young 
specimens from other oceans labeled as this species.

% to I inch in length, moderately strong. Apex small, elevated and 
hooked over toward the anterior end. Behind it is a small, elongate slit pene- 
trating through the shell. Internally the slit is separated from the apex by a 
calcareous, convex shelf. Exterior with 14 to 23 major ribs and with i to 5 
smaller radial ribs between the main ones. The fewer the ribs, the stronger 
they are. Shell dull-gray externally, glossy-white inside. The border is cren- 
ulated. Found at low tide in Alaska and dredged from 20 to 75 fathoms off 
southern California. 

Puncturella galeata Gould Helmet Puncturella

basal edge; with numerous, much finer radial ribs, and with the internal shelf 
behind the slit reinforced by a second, straight shelf. Commonly dredged in 
mud from 10 to 75 fathoms. 

Subfainily DIODORINAE 
Genus Diodora Gray 1821 

Keyhole Limpets with the internal callus of the hole truncated and fre- 
quently minutely excavated behind; shell with its basal margin never raised 
at the ends. Central tooth of the radula wide. Compare with Fissurella. 
Diadora is a misspelling. 

Diodora cayetiensis Lamarck Cayenne Keyhole Limpet 

Plate 17m 
Virginia to south half of Florida and to Brazil. 

I to 2 inches in maximum diameter. Orifice just in front of and slightly 
lower than the apex. Many radial ribs with each fourth one larger. Color 
variable from whitish, pinkish to dark gray. Interior white or bluish gray. 
Just behind the callus of the orifice on the inside there is a deep pit. D. listeri 
is much more coarsely sculptured. A common intertidal to moderately deep 
water species. It was named by Thomas Say one month after Lamarck's 
description as D. alterjiata. 

Diodora listeri Orbigny Lister's Keyhole Limpet 

Plate 17I 

South half of Florida and the West Indies. 



FISSURELLIDAE 97 

I to 2 inches in maximum diameter. Similar to D. cayenensis but differs 
in that: (i) every second radial rib is larger; (2) concentric threads are more 
distinct and, by crossing the ribs, form little squares; (3) radial ribs often 
have nodules or scales. Color usually white, cream or gray, sometimes with 
obscure radial bands. Intertidal. Common in the West Indies. 

Diodora minuta Lamarck Dwarf Keyhole Limpet 

Southeast Florida and the West Indies. 

/4 inch in maximum diameter, rather thin, depressed. Apex at anterior 
third of shell. Base elliptical, raised slightly at the center, so that the shell 
rests on its ends. Short front slope slightly concave, back slope convex. Ori- 
fice narrow and trilobated. Exterior shiny, with numerous, finely beaded 
radial ribs. Color white, with many of the ribs entirely or partly blackened. 
Margin very finely crenulate. Internal callus around hole frequently bounded 
by a black line. Not very common. Dredged 6 to 72 fathoms, but has been 
picked up on beaches. Do not confuse with D. dysoni which is more likely 
to be encountered, especially at Sanibel Island. 

Diodora dysoni Reeve Dyson's Keyhole Limpet

Florida, the Bahamas and West Indies to Brazil. 

H to % inch in maximum diameter, depressed and with straight sides. 
Base ovate. Apex slightly in front of the middle and characterized by a blunt 
knob situated behind the posterior wall of the small, almost triangular orifice. 
Sculpture of 18 strong ribs with three smaller ones between, and with nu- 
merous concentric lamellae. Color milky-white or cream with 8 solid, broken 
or dotted black rays. Margin sharply crenulated with the denticles arranged 
in groups of four. Distinguished from cayenensis by the shape of the orifice. 
Moderately common, sometimes washed ashore. 

Diodora aspera Eschscholtz Rough Keyhole Limpet 

Plate 1 8b 
Cook's Inlet, Alaska, to Magdalena Bay, Mexico. 

I % to 2 ^ inches in maximum diameter, slightly less than Vs as high. The 
roundish to slightly oval, flat-sided apical hole is Mi the length of the shell 
and about Vs back from the narrow, anterior end of the shell. Sculpture of 
coarse radial and weaker concentric threads. Color externally is grayish 
white with about 12 to 18 irregularly sized, purplish blue, radial color bands. 
Commonly found clinging to rocks at low tide. In the south, dredged no 
deeper than 20 fathoms, and often found on the stems of kelp.

Crescent City, California, to Magdalena Bay, Mexico. 

% inch in length, similar to aspera, but smaller, with a lower, more 
rounded apex, with convex sides, a narrower shell, and with finer, much 
neater cancellate sculpturing. Color white or with few, or many, broken 
radial rays of gray-black. The apical hole is nearer the anterior end. Mod- 
erately common on rocks. This is D. densiclathrata of authors, not of Reeve. 

Genus Lucapina Sowerby 1835

I to I % inches in maximum diameter, elliptical in outline, with a mod- 
erately high apex which is placed Vs to almost % way back from the anterior 
end. With about 25 axial, weakly developed, radial ribs. Edge of shell slightly 
wavy. External color of strong black radial, often intertwining, stripes on a

Acmaea fenestrata Reeve Fenestrate Limpet 

Plate i8t 

Alaska to Lower California. 

I to I /4 inches in maximum diameter, almost round in outline, rather 
high, and smoothish. The northern subspecies, cribraria Gould (pi. i8w), 
found from Alaska to northern California, has interior with various shades of 
glossy, chocolate-brown, and with a narrow, solid black border. The exterior 
is plain dark-gray. The typical southern fenestrata Reeve (pi. i8t), found 
from Point Conception south, has an external color pattern of regular dot- 
tings of cream on a gray-green background. Its interior has a small, brown 
apical spot surrounded by a bluish area and bordered at the margin of the 
shell with brown. Intergrades occur near Point Conception. This species is 
the only Pacific Acmaea which lives among loose boulders that are set in sand. 
It only feeds when submerged. Common.

% inch in maximum diameter. Shell low, and like A. scabra, is with 
distinct but widely spaced, radial ribs. Distinguished from scabra by its 
glossy, smooth interior which often has an evenly colored brown center. 
A. scabra has a rough interior center and the brown stain looks smeared. 
However, this species may be a form of scabra. It is very abundant south of 
La Jolla and is found with A. scabra and A. digitalis.

ACMAEIDAE 103 

I to 1% inches in maximum diameter, elliptical to almost round in out- 
line, low to quite flat. Characterized by radial rows of small beads which 
sometimes may be crowded together to form tiny, rough riblets. Exterior 
greenish black. Interior glossy-white, younger specimens having a blue tint. 
Patch of brown on inside generally weak or absent. Edge of shell usually with 
solid, black-brown, narrow band. Occasional albinos are cream-brown or tan 
on the outside. Compare with A. scutum which is smooth and has a barred 
band of color on its under edge. 

Ac77mea digitalis Eschscholtz Fingered Limpet 

Plate i8f 

Aleutian Islands to Socorro Island, Mexico. 

1% inch in maximum diameter, elliptical in outline; generally with a 
moderately high apex which is minutely hooked forward and which is placed 
Vz back from the anterior end of the shell. The 15 to 25 moderately devel- 
oped, coarse, radiating ribs give the edge of the shell a slightly wavy border. 
Color grayish with tiny, distinct mottlings of white dots and blackish streaks 
and lines. Inside white with faint bluish tint and with a large, usually even, 
patch of dark-brown in the center. Edge of shell v/ith a solid or broken, 
narrow band of black-brown. Common. Do not confuse this species with 
A. scabra which does not have the "hooked-forward" apex and is not glossy 
on its internal brown patch. Compare also with persona. 

Acmaea persona Eschscholtz Mask Limpet 

Plate i8q 

Aleutian Islands to Monterey, California. 

I to 1% inches in maximum diameter, with characters much the same 
as those of digitalis, but differing in being smoothish, larger, often slightly 
higher, and in having a strong tint of blue or blue-black inside. I am inclined 
to believe that Pilsbry is correct in considering digitalis as a smaller, ribbed 
form of persona, despite the fact that recent workers place these two species 
in different subgenera. It is possible that colder waters allow the smooth 
persona form to express itself. The Mask Limpet is very common from 
Monterey north. It is an intertidal dweller where strong waves flush the rock 
crevices. It feeds mostly during the ebb tide and is more active during dark 
hours. The small southern subspecies, strigatella Carpenter, is about H inch 
in size, dark gray-blue inside, and externally with a mass of intertwining or 
joining radial bars of brown on a bluish or gray-white background.

apex which is placed % back from the front end. The 15 to 25 strong, coarse 
radiating ribs give the edge of the shell a strong crenulation. Color dirty 
gray-green. Underside of shell whitish, irregularly stained in the center with 
blackish brown. Edge of shell between the serrations is stained blackish to 
purplish brown. A common species found clinging to rocks high above the 
water line but within reach of the ocean spray. A. spectrum Nuttall is the 
same species. Do not confuse with the smaller A. conus which is evenly 
glossed, instead of coarse and dull, on its interior center.

with about a dozen fairly regular, small, spiral cords. The angular periphery 
of the whorls bears the largest cord. Umbilicus round, deep, and furrowed 
on its sides by two spiral cords, the upper one ending at the columella in a 
fairly sizeable bead. Columella set back quite far at its upper half; the lower 
section bears the bead, and below that there are several, smaller, indistinct 
beads. Color of shell grayish to brownish white with small mottlings of 
reddish or blackish brown. Operculum, as in all Tegula, horny and multi- 
spiral. Formerly scalaris Anton (not Brocchi) and indusi "Gmelin." Com- 
mon under rocks in the West Indies, but uncommon on the Lower Florida 
Keys.

34 inch in length and width. Characterized by its bluish-gray color, 
corrugated sculpture (weak spiral cords and oblique lines of growth), its 
concave base, thin outer lip, and especially by the blue-green to iridescent- 
green circle of color around the very deep, round, narrow umbilicus. A 
variant exists in some areas which lacks the green, umbilical color and in 
which the spiral cords are stronger and the shell with axial, slanting bars of 
black-brown. Very common in the West Indies, along the rocky shores.

A small worm-like shell with detached whorls throughout. Character- 
ized by the long row of small holes or elongate slits on the middle of the 
whorl. Early whorls smooth, white; later whorls becoming very spinose and 
stained with brown. The coiling is very irregular and loose. Grows to about 
5 or 6 inches in length. T. modestus Dall may be the young of this species. 

Family CAECIDAE 

These tiny, cucumber-shaped mollusks are occasionally found by screen- 
ing the beach sand in warm water areas or by shaking out dead sponges. The 
Caecums begin life in a normal snail-like manner with a tiny, spiral shell, but 
within a few weeks they grow only in one direction to form a simple, slightly 
curved tube. The spiral apex is usually knocked off and the hole plugged

with a septum. As additional growth takes place, the animal retreats grad- 
ually from the apical or rear portion and forms new, internal septa. The 
operculum is thin, circular, homy, and multispiral.

6.0 mm, in length. Color pinkish brown to chalky-white with occa- 
sional darker brown mottlings. With about loo fine, squarish, closely set 
axial rings. Plug with a rather long, oblique spur. Spur sometimes eroded 
down to a small sharp pimple (form oregonense Bartsch). Irregularities oc- 
cur in the expansion of the tube; sometimes there is a more rapid expansion 
toward the anterior end (forms named as species: C. pedroeiise Bartsch and 
C. barkleyense Bartsch). C. catalinense Bartsch is probably this species, since 
many of the paratypes do not have the anterior end supposedly "bulbously 
expanded," and many specimens have about loo axial rings, and not 75 as 
claimed. C. rosaniim Bartsch appears to be a very long specimen (7 mm.) 
with sharply defined rings. Common. 

Subgenus Elephantanellwn Bartsch 

3 to 5 mm. in length, white, with axial rings and longitudinal ribs. One 
species in southern California and 3 or 4 in the Western Atlantic. They 
resemble minute scaphopods, but are distinguished from them by the apical 
plug and small size of the shell.

Family XENOPHORIDAE 

Genus Xenophora Fischer von W. 1807 

This group of gastropods is noted for its peculiar habit of cementing 
to its own shell fragments of other shells, stones, bits of coral and coal. The 
animals resemble those of the Strombus conchs, but the operculum is much 
wider and not sickle-shaped. B. R. Bales once humorously observed: 



i 



STROMBIDAE 17 3 

"It is generally admitted that the camouflage of Xe?iophora is for protection 
rather than ornamentation, for it would be inconceivable that a female 
Xenophora would call over the back fence to her girl friend with, 'Come 
and see the perfect dream of a shell I picked up today and tell me if I have 
it on straight.' " 

There are 3 species in the Atlantic, one a shallow water species, the other two 
(longleyi Bartsch, pi. 23d, and caribaea Petit, pi. 2 3e) deep water inhabit- 
ants.

Genus Vhaliwn Link 1807 

These are miniature helmet shells which rarely exceed a length of 5 
inches. The Scotch Bonnet of Florida (Phaliiim grajiulatwn) is well-known 
to most collectors. This genus differs from Cassis in having much smaller 
shells which do not have an extended, upturned siphonal canal and do not 
develop a massive parietal shield. Typical Fhalium which has 4 or 5 tiny 
spines on the base of the outer lip (as for example in the Indo-Pacific geno- 
type, P. glaiicwn Linne) is not represented in American waters. Our two 
species belong to the subgenus Seinicassis which lacks these tiny spines. 
Operculum as in Cassis.

beaded. Lower parietal area pustulose. Outer lip may be greatly thickened 
occasionally. Not uncommonly washed ashore. It is also present on the 
west coast of Central America as the subspecies centiqiiadrata Valenciennes. 
Formerly known as Semicassis abbreviata Lamarck and S. inflatum Shaw.

Shell i'V2 to 2 inches in length, similar to P. granulatum but without 
the spiral grooves; sometimes smaller specimens have nodules on the shoulder 
of the whorl. Rare in Florida. Meuschen named this shell first, but his 
works are now ruled out as invalid. The nodulated, smaller variety was 
named peristephes Pilsbry and McGinty. 

Genus Cassis Scopoli 1777 

The helmet shells are large, handsome mollusks which have been used 
by man for centuries. Large numbers of cameos are still cut from them, 
the meat is often used in chowders, and the uncut shells serve as attractive 
doorstops or mantel-pieces. In the Pacific, they are sliced in half and the 
body whorl used either as a cooking container or boat-bailer. The half dozen 
known species are found only in the West Indies and Indo-Pacific area. They 
live in moderately deep water and although sometimes are obtained in knee- 
deep waters, they usually must be dived for in 10 to 20 feet of water. The 
helmet shells are carnivorous and include the spiny sea urchins in their diet. 
Operculum semicircular, corneous and concentric. 

Cassis tuberosa Linne King Helmet 

Southeast Florida and the West Indies. 

Adults 4 to 9 inches in length, massive, with a finely reticulated sculp- 
ture. Color brownish cream with black-brown patches on the lip and a 
large patch of brown at the center of the parietal shield. This species may 
be easily confused with the Flame Helmet (Cassis fiaminea Linne) which 
occurs in the Bahamas and Antilles. The latter lacks the reticulated sculpture, 
lacks brown color between the teeth on the outer lip, has a rounded (not 
triangular) parietal shield and is from 3 to 5 inches in length. Rare in Florida 
(10 fathoms), common to the south in shallow water.

spines; the topmost spine of the first row generally the largest. Color pale- 
cream on the outer surface. Parietal shield and outer lip pale- to deep-salmon. 
Teeth white, brown sometimes between them. Moderately common from 
5 to 10 fathoms in the Bahamas. Very rare in Florida where it is replaced 
by the Clench's Helmet, the subspecies spinella Clench.

Similar to the typical madagascariensis, but with numerous small, evenly 
sized spines, more noticeable on the top row. Frank Lyman has collected 
this novel form or subspecies by the dozen in 20 feet of water off the Florida 
Keys. It is not a rarity and has been in old collections for many years. We 
have seen specimens labelled as coming from the Bimini Islands, Bahamas, 
but the record needs confirmation.

5 to 7 inches in length. Characterized by the large shell, and the strong, 
straight, rather short spines. Exterior milky-white to dirty-gray. Aperture 
enamel white. Thin spiral color lines are usually prominent on the whorls. 
Fairly common along the shallow areas of northeastern Florida where they 
are found abundantly during the breeding season. Well-known to the shrimp 
fishermen whose nets often ensnare them. Murex burryi Clench and Far- 
fante is probably the young of this species.

grayish white to cream. This is probably the rarest of our eastern Murex 
species. Recently, one specimen was dredged oif northeast Florida in a few 
fathoms of water.

varices which arch backwards and bear sharp fronds. Raised, spiral lines 
prominent between the varices. Color variable from cream to dark-brown. 
Uncommon in the Lower Keys, but fairly common to abundant in the West

frondose, scaly spines bordering the outer lip and siphonal canal. Top spine 
sometimes twice as long as the others. Color dark-brown, light-brown, or 
whitish and, in the latter case, the nuclear whorls at the spire are pinkish. 
Usually I axial low ridge between each varix, although occasionally with 
more and smaller axial ribs. 

The Lace Murex is one of Florida's most common species in this genus. 
It lives in a wide variety of habitats from mangrove, muddy areas to protected 
rocks and frequently in clear, sandy areas. The ecological variety, which 
is whitish and with reduced spines, was named arenarius by Clench and 
Farfante. This species differs from the 4 to 5 inch-long M. brevifrons in 
being smaller, in having closely crowded scaly spines, and in having a round 
instead of elongate operculum. For many years this species was called rufus 
Lamarck 1822 (not rufus Montagu 1803).

Murex cellulosus Conrad Pitted Murex 

Figure 45b 

North Carolina to Florida, the Gulf of Mexico and the West Indies. 

I inch in length. Shell rough, with 5 to 7 poorly developed fluted varices. 
It rarely develops spines, but when present they are short and stubby with 
a thin webbing connecting each spine in the varix. The siphonal canal 
strongly upturned. Aperture small, almost round. Color a dull grayish white. 

This is one of the smallest and most compact species of Murex on the 
Atlantic Coast and is often found in shallow, intertidal waters, especially near 
oyster beds where it probably does moderate damage to young oysters. Its 
identification is made difficult when the siphonal canal has been broken off

completely. A deep water form, M. celhilosiis levimilus Dall (pi. 25J), of 
more delicate sculpturing and with brown markings, is found off the coast 
of North Carolina and eastern Florida. An inch-long, chubby subspecies, 
nuceus Morch (pi. 251), with a shorter and wider siphonal canal and heavily 
scaled varices, occurs in the West Indies but has been collected by Dr. J. S. 
Schwengel on Tea Table Key, Lower Florida Keys, and off Fort Walton 
by Mr. L. A. Burry,

1 to 2% inches in length. Spire high. No spines. Each varix is a high, 
rounded, thin plate or web. Between these varical webs there is a single, 
low, rounded nob. Color a uniform cream-white. A bizarre species which 
is the least spinose of our American forms. It is being collected in dredging 
operations along the west coast of Florida in increasing numbers, although it 
remains a rarity. It was named after one of our foremost malacologists at 
Harvard University, Dr. Joseph C. Bequaert. Dall identified this species as 
Murex macropterus Desh. 

Murex trialatus Sowerby Western Three-winged Murex

2 to 3 inches in length, with 3 large, wavy, wing-like varices per whorl. 
Siphonal canal closed along its length. The body whorl between each varix 
is smoothish, with or without one low, rounded tubercle, and sometimes with 
2 to 5 weak, spiral cords or threads. Anterior face of each varix with fine, 
crowded, axial fimbriations. Color grayish, dark- or light-brown, or with 
white spiral bands. 

Typical trialatus from southern California and Lower California reaches 
a length of 3 inches, is generally dark chestnut to blackish brown with 4 to 6 
narrow white bands, and has very fine spiral threads which are sometimes 
scaled, beaded or smooth. 

The subspecies carpenter! Dall (fig. 45c) — tremperi Dall and petri Dall 
are ecological forms or color varieties, as is the all-white alba Berry — has 
larger wings which are smooth on the posterior face. The color is generally 
light yellowish brown, all-white or with 2 wide white bands. Common off- 
shore.

other in the middle area of the whorl, but in the area of the suture, and again 
near the base of the shell, the varix is thin, elevated and curled back and may 
bear one or several small spines. There are several spiral low cords colored 
blackish blue which are more obvious on the middle or smoother part of the 
whorl. The spire appears to have squarish pits crudely dug out. Very com- 
mon along rocky areas under protective rubble and masses of worm tubes.

Muricopsis ostrearum Conrad Mauve-mouth Drill 

Figure 47g 

West coast of Florida to the Florida Keys. 

I inch in length, extraordinarily like Urosalpinx perrugata, but more 
elongate, with a longer siphonal canal which is bent slightly back, and with 
a light-mauve aperture. Moderately common from low tide area to 35 
fathoms. M. fioridmja Conrad is this species. 

Genus Fseudoneptunea Kobelt 1882

North Carolina to both sides of Florida and the West Indies. 

I to I /4 inches in length, rather broad, with a short, fairly open siphonal 
canal. Outer lip sharp, finely crenulated. At the base of the columella there 
is a single, small fold. 8 to 9 short, rounded axial ribs on the periphery of the 
whorl. Spiral cords weak. Color gray with red-brown specklings; some- 
times solid yellow-orange. Moderately common.

I to I /4 inches in length, rather low-spired, solid, smoothish, except for 
numerous, poorly developed, spiral threads. Spine on lower, outer lip is 
strong, behind which on the base of the outside of the body whorl is a weak, 
spiral groove. Whorls slightly shouldered. Color bluish gray with numerous 
rows of small, red-brown dots. Aperture within is bluish white. A round- 
shouldered, smaller form (punctulata Sby. or lapilloides Conrad) is found 



212 American Seashells 

from Monterey to Lower California. A common southern species found 
above high-tide mark on rocks; also on mussel beds. 

Acanthina paucilirata Steams Checkered Thorn Drupe 

San Pedro, California, to Lower Cahfomia. 

% to /4 inch in length, characterized by about 6 spiral rows of small 
squares of black-brown on a cream-white background. Early whorls cancel- 
late, later whorls smoothish except for 4 or 5 very small, smooth, raised, spiral 
threads. Top of whorl slightly concave. Spine at base of outer lip small and 
needle-like. Aperture dentate, brownish with black squares on the outer lip. 
Siphonal canal short. Common above high-tide mark in southern California. 

Genus Urosalpinx Stimpson 1865 
Urosalpinx cinerea Say Atlantic Oyster Drill 

Figure 470 

Nova Scotia to southern Florida. Introduced to San Francisco and to 
England. 

% to I inch in length; without varices; outer lip slightly thickened on 
the inside and sometimes with 2 to 6 small, whitish teeth. Siphonal canal 
moderately short and straight. With about 9 to 12 rounded, axial ribs per 
whorl and with numerous, strong, spiral cords. Color grayish or yellowish 
white, often with irregular, brown, spiral bands. Aperture tan to dark-brown. 
This common species is very destructive to oysters. It occurs from intertidal 
areas down to about 25 feet or more. Females grow faster and hence are 
larger than the males. They may reach an age of 7 years. The drills move 
inshore to spawn. Each female spawns once a year (May to September in 
Virginia; June to September in Canada and England). The female deposits 
25 to 28 leathery, vase-shaped capsules, each containing 8 to 12 eggs. U. fol- 
lyensis B. Baker is an ecologic form. 

Urosalpinx perrugata Conrad Gulf Oyster Drill 

Figure 47 d 
West coast of Florida (to Louisiana?). 

Similar to cinerea, but with 6 to 9 axial ribs which are quite large at the 
periphery of the whorl. The spiral cords are fewer and stronger. Aperture 
rosy-brown or yellow-brown. Outer lip more thickened on the inside and 
usually with 6 small, whitish teeth. This may be a subspecies of cinerea. 
Common on mudflats. Always compare with Muricopsis ostreanmt Conrad 
which resembles this species very closely. 



MURICIDAE 213 

Urosalpinx tampaensis Conrad Tampa Drill 

Tampa Bay area, west Florida. 

V2 to I inch in length; the light-brown aperture is thickened and the 
outer lip has 6 small, white teeth. With about 9 to 1 1 sharp, axial ribs per 
whorl, crossed by about 9 to i o equally strong spiral cords on the last whorl, 
thus giving the shell a cancellate sculpture. The whorls in the spire show 
only 2 spiral, nodulated cords. Exterior dark-gray. Common on mudflats. 

Genus Purpura Bruguiere 1789 
Purpura patula Linne Wide-mouthed Purpura 

Plate 25I 

Southeast Florida and the West Indies. 

2 to 3/4 inches in length; without an umbilicus. Exterior dull, rusty- 
gray. Columella salmon-pink. Inner borders of aperture with splotches of 
blackish brown. Common in the West Indies, uncommon in Florida. The 
animal exudes a harmless hquid which stains the hands and collecting bag a 
permanent violet. 

The subspecies pansa Gould (west coast of Mexico south to Columbia) 
is similar in most respects, but the columella is colored a whitish cream. 

Genus Thais Roding 1798 
Subgenus Stramonita Schumacher 1817 

Thais haemastoma floridaJia Conrad Florida Rock-shell 

Plate 25a 

North Carolina to Florida, and the Caribbean. 

2 to 3 inches in length, solid, smooth to finely nodulose. Color light- 
gray to yellowish with small flecks and irregular bars of brownish. Interior 
of aperture salmon-pink, often with brown between the denticulations of the 
outer lip. Running inside the aperture high up on the body whorl above the 
parietal area, there is a strong spiral ridge. Some specimens have a faint fold

strong nodules on the shoulder of the whorls. M. D. Burkenroad (1931) has 
given a long account of the biology of this oyster pest. 

Thais rustica Lamarck Rustic Rock-shell 

Plate 25f 

Southeast Florida and the West Indies. Bermuda. 

I /4 inches in length, irregularly sculptured with 2 spiral rows of blunt 
spines, one on the shoulder, the other at the center of the body whorl. Color 
dirty-gray to dull mottled brown. Interior of aperture whitish but generally 
margined with spots of dark-brown along the outer lip. Parietal wall glossy- 
white. This species is smaller and more nodulose than floridana and always 
has a white aperture. Erroneously called Thais imdata Lamarck which is an 
Indo-Pacific species. 

Three confusing species are often found together in southern Florida. 
The young of Canthariis tinctits (see p. 233) has the lower third of its white 
columella turned away (to the left) 20 degrees from the axis of the shell, and 
its early whorls in the spire are not shouldered. Thais haemastoina floridana 
is characterized by its almost straight, cream to orange columella, and by the 
numerous raised cream or white spiral ridges on the inside of the outer lip. 
Thais rustica has a stouter, white columella which is slightly twisted and 
purple-stained at the lower, inner corner. Its outer lip teeth occur in groups 
of 2 or 3 and near the edge of the lip are stained by heavy blotches of purple- 
brown.

can be either left-handed (formerly known as kieneri Philippi 1848) or 
right-handed (formerly known as eliceans Montfort 18 10, pi. 23k). The 
name B. perversum or Fulgur perversa in most old popular books refers to B. 
contrarhmi. The perverse whelk is an uncommon species. It is characterized 
by the heavy, polished shell and the swollen, rounded ridge around the 
middle of the whorl. Dredged from 4 to 10 fathoms.

much more slender, with a higher spire and with numerous exceedingly fine, 
incised (cut) spiral lines. Some specimens have the early whorls slightly 
angled and with short axial ribs. This is the form named florida Clench and 
Aguayo and is probably not a good species. A rare species which is appear- 
ing in private collections more and more. 

Scaphella dubia Broderip Dubious Volute 

Off south half of Florida and the Gulf of Mexico. 

4 inches in length, similar to dohrni, but more slender, with fewer spots,

pale salmon and with 4 or 5 spiral rows of weak, brown, square spots. A 
thick, yellowish-gray glaze overlays the periostracum on the parietal side of 
the body whorl. Columella straight, while in R. georgiajia Clench from 
Georgia to east Florida it is arched. Both quite rare, the former in 80 fathoms 
of water. The genus Rehderia Clench 1946 was unfortunately erected upon 
an ecological or pathological character and should be considered a synonym

Florida and the Gulf of Mexico. 

2 to 3 inches in length; spire slightly elevated in the center. Top of 
whorls smooth, except for tiny growth lines. Color white with spiral rows 
of orange-yellow squares. Interior of aperture white. A rather common and 
attractive species found in shallow water. True spurius spurius Gmelin from

sional mottlings. Another race occurs off Yucatan in which the spots are 
sometimes smaller and a rather dark bluish purple. 

Conus aureofasciatus Rehder and Abbott Golden-banded Cone 

Plate i4g 

Tortugas to off Yucatan, Mexico. 

2 to 3 inches in length, similar in shape to spurius, although sometimes 
more slender. Characterized by several spiral bands of light-yellow. Dredged 
in several fathoms of water. Uncommon to rare. It is possible that this spe- 
cies may be only a freak color form of spurius.

about 10 to 12 whorls. Shoulders of whorls slightly rounded; sides nearly 
flat. Color a pale pinkish brown to orangish with a moderate and indistinct 
band of cream or white at the mid area. This is overlaid with a series of fine 
spiral, broken lines or dots of brown. Spire whitish with axial, zigzag, reddish 
brown streaks. A choice collector's item. Named after Mrs. WiUiam J. 
Clench, a great contributor to the cause of malacology.

has faint lines of growth. Color variable: usually white with elongate, rather 
wide patches of light orange-yellow to yellow. Spire with splashes of color. 
There is usually a white, spiral band around the middle of the whorl which 
may have small dots of yellowish brown. Moderately common in shallow 
water to 7 fathoms. 

Conus ftoridaniis floridensis Sowerby (pi. 146) is an extremely dark color 
form with spiral rows of reddish brown dots and heavier mottlings. 

C. floridanus biirryae Clench is another color form from off the Lower 
Florida Keys in which the spiral rows of brownish dots merge into solid lines. 
The lower end of the shell in very dark brown to deep brownish black. Un- 
common.

each whorl also concave and with fine, arched lines of growth. There are lo 
to 12 small spiral ridges at the lower end of the shell. Sides of whorls flat. 
Color as shown in the photograph, with the two whitish spiral bands being 
characteristic. Large and perfect specimens are collector's items, although 
individuals less than 2 inches in length are rather commonly dredged in 50 
feet of water off both sides of Florida. Beach specimens have been collected 
on rare occasions. Named after the sponge diver, Sozon Vatikiotis. 

Conus regius Gmelin Crown Cone 

Plate 14m 
Southern Florida and the West Indies. 

2 to 3 inches in length. Spire low; shoulders of whorls with low, irreg- 
ular knobs or tubercles. Color very variable even in the same locality. A 
rare yellowish color form (citrmus Gmelin, not Clench 1942) occurs in the 
Lower Florida Keys, Cuba and the Antilles. The interior of the aperture of 
this species is white. Uncommon in Florida. 

Conus mus Hwass Mouse Cone

with low, irregular, white knobs, between which are brown splotches. Color 
a dull bluish gray with olive-green or brown mottlings. Interior of aperture 
with 2 wide spiral bands of subdued brown. Periostracum thick, velvety and 
yellowish to greenish brown. The name Conus citrinus Gmelin (erroneously 
applied to this species in Johnsonia and other books) is actually the yellow 
form of regius. The Mouse Cone is very common in intertidal, reef areas.

Plate 14k 

Southeast Florida and the West Indies. 

1% to 2 inches in length. A long, narrow, and very handsome species 
which has rows of delicate beads on the very high spire. This is probably 
the most valuable cone in Florida waters. A few fortunate collectors in 
Florida have dredged this unusual cone. 

Conus granulatus Linne Glory-of-the-Atlantic Cone 

Plate 14I 

Southeast Florida and the West Indies. 

I to I % inches in length. A fairly slender cone with rounded whorls in 
the spire which have spiral threads. Colored a brilhant orange-red to bright- 
red with flecks of brown and gold. Coarse spiral threads are usually present 
on the sides. Interior of aperture with a rosy-pink blush. A perfect specimen 
of this species is, indeed, a collector's item. It is very rare in Florida and not 
at all common in the West Indies. It lives in reefs just offshore. 

Coims anstiin Rehder and Abbott Austin's Cone 

Tortugas to Yucatan and West Indies. 

1 MO iV-z inches in length, pure white in color, although some may have 
a yellow-brown apex. Characterized by numerous odd-sized spiral threads on 
the sides. Sides of whorls flat to slightly rounded. Shoulders sharp to slightly 
rounded. Top of whorls slightly concave, with one smooth spiral carina and 
several much smaller threads. Shell sometimes with axial puckerings or rib- 
like wrinkles. Periostracum velvety and grayish brown. Rare off Florida but 
common in 20 fathoms off Yucatan. 

Cojiiis clarki Rehder and Abbott Clark.'s Cone 

Plate 141 

Off Louisiana. 

I to i^ inches in length, whitish in color and with small weak spots, 
rather turnip-shaped, similar to austini, but with 27 to 30 very strong, squar- 
ish spiral cords on the sides. The cords, and especially the one at the shoulder, 
are strongly beaded. Between the cords there are microscopic, axial threads. 
Periostracum gray. Apparently rare offshore in 29 fathoms. This and the 
preceding species were named after Austin H. Clark, scientist, author and 
gentleman. C. frisbeyae Clench and Pulley 1952 is unquestionably this spe- 
cies. 



TEREBRIDAE 265 

Conus californiciis Hinds Californian Cone

Virginia to Florida, Texas and the West Indies. 

1/4 to 2 inches in length, slender. Whorls with about 25 axial ribs per 
whorl which are divided % to ^ their length by a deep, impressed, spiral 
line. Many specimens show prominent, squarish, raised spiral cords between 
the ribs. Columella with 2 fused spiral folds near the base. Color a dirty, 
pinkish gray, but sometimes orangish. A common shallow-water species. 

Terebra tanr'wa Solander Flame Auger 

Plate i3h 
Southeast Florida, the Gulf of Mexico and the West Indies. 

4 to 6 inches in length, heavy, rather slender. Characterized by a cream 
color with 2 spiral rows of axial, red-brown bars, the upper series being twice 
as long as the lower one. Upper M'horls faintly and axially ribbed. Upper 
half of each whorl swollen and with a single incised line. T. flannnea La- 
marck and T. jeldmajuii Roding are this species. Formerly considered quite 
rare, but now not infrequently dredged in the Gulf of Mexico. 

Terebra floridana Dall Florida Auger 

Off South Carolina to south Florida. 

2 to 3 inches in length, very long and slender. Color light-yellow to 
yellowish white. Each whorl has just below the suture a row of about 20 
oblong, slightly slanting, smooth axial ribs. Below this, and separated from it 
by an impressed line, is a similar row of much shorter, axial ribs. The lower 
third of the whorl is marked by 3 or 4 raised, spiral threads only. Columella 
with a single, strong fold near the bottom. A fairly rare species.

% inch in length, slender, about 1 2 whorls, semi-glossy, and with slightly 
concave whorls. Whorls in spire with a large, heavily nodulated or beaded, 
swollen spiral cord just below the suture. Above the suture there is a spiral 
series of 20 very small beads per whorl. The concave middle of the whorl 
bears about 5 microscopic, incised spiral lines. Color yellowish gray. Com- 
mon in shallow water. Do not confuse with the larger yellow T. floridana 
which has 2 spiral rows of elongate beads just below the suture. 

Terebra protexta Conrad Fine-ribbed Auger 

Plate 26k 

North Carolina to Florida and Texas. 

% to I inch in length, about 1 3 whorls, dull-white in color and with a 
well-indented suture. Whorls in spire slightly concave with about 22 fine 
axial ribs running from suture to suture, but which are broken weakly by 7 
to 9 incised spiral lines. The upper line is about % the way down the whorl. 

Several forms exist which have been given names: form lutescens Smith 
has about 30 to 32 finer axial riblets per whorl which are made slightly beaded 
by the spiral lines; in the form limatula Dall, the ribs and the spiral threads 
are about equal in size and give a reticulated pattern. All occur together in 
fairly deep water and are common.

1/4 to I ^ inches in length. Characterized by its smooth, highly glossy 
finish, its numerous axial ribs which extend from suture to suture, and by its 
bright yellowish color and white band below the suture. Columella smooth- 
ish and white. This is the "fattest" species in the western Atlantic, and is 
fairly common in the West Indies. 

Terebra cinerea Born Gray Atlantic Auger 

Plate 26g 

Southeast Florida and the West Indies, 

I to 2 inches in length, slender, with flat-sided whorls and a sharp apex. 
Numerous small riblets extend halfway down the whorls (about 45 to 50 
per whorl). Color all cream or bluish brown; sometimes with darker spots 
below the suture. Surface with exceedingly fine, numerous rows of pin- 
pricks which give the shell a silky appearance under the lens. Moderately 
common in shallow water. Compare with salleana Deshayes.

18 per whorl), followed below by a flat area which is weakly and axially 
wrinkled or ribbed and with numerous, fine, spiral, incised lines. Siphonal 
canal bounded by a sharp spiral line on the outer shell. Fairly common in 
shallow water. 

Fajnily TURRIDAE 

The family Turridae is a very large and diverse group of toxoglossate 
gastropods which are very difficult to classify. A book of this size cannot do 
justice to the many interesting species found in our waters. The family prob- 
ably contains no less than 500 genera and subgenera and several thousand 
species. An interesting and valuable review of the family is given by A. W. 
Powell in the Bulletin of the Auckland htstitute and Museum, no. 2, pp. i to 
188, 1942. Those interested should consult the works of Grant and Gale, 
Bartsch, Dall, Rehder, and Woodring. We have included here only a very 
sketchy representation of our American Turrid fauna. 

Subfamily TURRINAE 

Shells rather large, usually with a long, slender canal. Sinus on or adja- 
cent to peripheral keel; deep and V-shaped. Operculum leaf-shaped with an

Superjamily PYRAMIDELLACEA 
Family PYRAMIDELLIDAE 

This is a well-known family of very small gastropods which are ex- 
tremely baffling to novices attempting to identify any one of the several hun- 
dred so-called species. Even among the experts there is not always agreement 
on what constitutes a species, subgenus or genus in this group. It would be 
impossible to present in a book this siz^e even an account of only the most 
common species. Those interested in delving into this interesting maze of 
species are referred to the works of Bartsch, W. H. Dall and K. Bush. 

The recent work of Fretter and Graham has shown that the Pyrams are 
ectoparasites, with each species feeding on a particular host, usually a tubico- 
lous polychaete worm or a bivalve mollusk. The Pyrams attach themselves

with a buccal stylet. They suck the host's blood by means of a buccal pump. 
Embryological and other data have shown that this family of mollusks is 
closely related to the tectibranch mollusks, rather than to the prosobranchs 
with which they have been formerly placed. (See Journal of the Marine 
Biological Assoc, vol. 28, pp. 493-532, 1949.)

dweller. 

Order PTEROPODA 
(Sea Butterflies or Pteropods) 

These small, pelagic gastropods are very abundant in the open seas in 
nearly every part of the world. They are occasionally washed ashore, but 
more commonly their shells are found in dredge hauls. The identification of 
pteropods is important to many types of oceanographic studies. There are 
two suborders, Thecosomata or those having shells, and the Gymnosomata 
or those without shells. We have omitted the latter group, and refer inter- 
ested workers to our bibliography. Every known American species (eastern 
Pacific and western Atlantic) of the shelled Thecosomata has been included 
and figured.

is smooth, and with a dorsal groove not parallel to the axis of the shell, but 
slightly oblique, turning from left to right, with only the anterior extremity 
(which ends in a rostrum) in the median line. There is only one species in 
the genus and it is world-wide in distribution.

Hyalocylis striata Rang Striate Clio 

Worldwide m warm seas, pelagic. 



CAVOLINIDAE 295 

8 mm. in length, conical, slightly compressed dorso-ventrally (oval 
in cross-section); apex slightly recurved dorsally; surface with transverse 
grooves; embryonic shell small, smooth, bulbous and separated from the main 
shell by a constriction. This is the only species in the genus. 

Genus Clio Linne 1767 

Shell of a somewhat angular form, colorless, compressed dorso-ventrally, 
and with lateral keels. A cross-section of the anterior or open portion is thus 
always angular at the sides. There is generally a crest or ridge extending 
longitudinally along the back. Embryonic shell varies in form, but is always 
definitely separated from the rest of the shell. Cleodora Peron and Lesueur 
1 8 1 o is the same genus.

Genus Cavolina Abildgaard 1791 

Shell squat, bulbous, horny-brown in color, characterized by a much 
constricted aperture, which is, however, very broad transversely. Sides of 
shell often prolonged into spine-like projections. Cavolinia is an alternate, 
incorrect spelling, and Hyalaea Lamarck is a synonym of this genus. 



Cavolina lojigirostris Lesueur Long-snout Cavoline 

Figure 64V 

Worldwide, pelagic. (47° N. to 40° S.). 

5 to 9 mm. in length. Dorsal lip with a thin margin. Posterior portion 
of the ventral lip markedly projecting laterally. Common. Hyalaea li?nbata 
Orb. and H. angiilata Souleyet are synonyms. 



Cavolina gibbosa Rang Gibbose Cavoline 

Figure 64\v 

Worldwide, pelagic. (43° N. to 38^ S.). 

About 10 mm. in length. Dorsal lip with a thin margin. Shell without 
appreciable lateral points. Ventral lip not more developed than the dorsal. 
Ventral surface with an anterior transverse keel. Common.

Worldwide, pelagic. (40° N. to 40° S.). 

10 to 20 mm. in length. Dorsal lip with a thin margin. Ventral Hp not 
more developed than the dorsal one. Shell without appreciable lateral points. 
The shell is as broad at the end of the lips as it is at the anterior end. C. 
gibbosa is narrower at the ends of the lips. Hyalaea afflnis Orb. is merely a 
form of this species. C. televms Linne might possibly be this species.

varies somewhat in shape. C. oryza Benson, C. iirceolaris Morch and cmi- 
cellata Pfeffer are the same. Common. 

Suborder GYMNOSOMATA 

Pteropods characterized by the absence of shell, pallial cavity and 
mantle-skirt; by the presence of a well-developed head, bearing two pairs of 
tentacles, of which the two posterior bear rudimentary eyes. Jaws and radula 
present. Found pelagic in all seas, and sometimes in great abundance. Rarely 
exceed one inch in length. They are carnivorous. Ascend to the surface at 
night, and sink to a lower level in the daytime. They are not treated in this 
book. The group contains such genera as Pjieuviodennopsis Bronn 1862, 
Fneumodernia Cuvier 1805 {=^ Piieiimono derma Agassiz), Cliopsis Troschel

Subclass PULMONATA Order BASO MM ATOP MORA 

Family SIPHON ARllDAE 
Genus Siphonaria Sowerby 1824 

Shells closely resembling the true limpets, Acmaea, but at once distin- 
guished by the nature of the muscle scars on the inside. In both, the long, 
narrow scar is horseshoe-shaped, but in Siphonaria the gap between the ends 
is located on one side of the shell, while in Acmaea it is located at the front 
end. In some Siphonaria, the area near the gap is trough-shaped. These 
are air-breathers and are more closely related to the land garden snails than 
to the gill-bearing, water-breathing limpets.

About I inch in length, oblong to oval, elevated and rather acutely 
angular. Colored a light-tan over which is a heavy suffusion of dark-red 
maculations and specks. Upper surface appears smooth, although under 
high magnification it is seen to be granulated. Lateral areas of intermediate 
valves not very distinctly outlined. Interior of valves tinted with rose. Pos- 
terior valve with 8 to 9 slits. Girdle is leathery and without scales or bristles. 
Superficially this species resembles Ischnochiton ruber which, however, has 
scales on its girdle. Common from i to 50 fathoms. 

Tonicella lineata Wood Lined Red Chiton 

Japan to the Aleutians to San Diego, California. 

About an inch in length, similar to T. marjuorea, but with its valves 
smooth and shiny, and it is brightly painted with black-brown lines bordered 
with white which run obliquely backwards on the intermediate valves. The 
end valves have these same color lines concentrically arranged. Common 
on the rocky shores of Alaska. The young live in waters off the shore 
from 10 to 30 fathoms, but as they mature they migrate toward shore. 

Genus Lepidochitona Gray 1821 
Subgenus Cyanoplax Pilsbry 1892 

Lepidochitona dentiens Gould Gould's Baby Chiton 

Alaska to Monterey County, California. 

% inch or slightly more in length, oval, slightly elevated. Color tawny, 
olivaceous, slaty or brownish, usually covered with specklings of a darker 
hue. Upper surface of valves covered with microscopic, sharp granulations 
which are rarely aligned in any direction. Lateral areas may be slightly 
raised, and may be bounded in front by a very low rib. The apex of the 
posterior valve is near the center and is raised; behind the apex, the valve 



314 American Seashells 

is concave. Girdle very narrow, same color as the valves, and with very 
minute, gritty granules. 

L. (C.) dentiens is a common intertidal form found north of Monterey 
County, California. It is replaced to the south by the very similar and 
common L. (L.) keepiana Berry (Keep's Baby Chiton). In the former, the 
insertion teeth are prominently developed, their bounding slits in general 
widely V-shaped, and the teeth of the posterior valve very acute on the 
sides; the eaves are wide and conspicuously porous or "spongy." In the latter 
species, there are numerous short, fiarroivly slitted teeth in the terminal 
valves, and extremely thin, narrow, less openly porous eaves. (See S. S. Berry, 
1948, Leaflets in Malacology, vol. i, no. 4.) 

Lepidochitoiia hart^uegi Carpenter ' Hartweg's Baby Chiton 

Washington to Lower California. 

I to 1 34 inches in length, oval, rather flattened. Similarly colored to L. 
de?itiens. Girdle narrow and finely granulated. Sculpture of the end valves 
and the lateral areas of the middle valves differs from the microscopic granu- 
lations of dentiens in bearing easily seen, but very tiny, warts. It also differs 
in having the area behind the apex of the posterior valve convex instead of 
concave. Moderately common in intertidal areas. 

Genus Nuttallina Carpenter 1879

brown to olive-brown. Upper surface of valves finely granulated and with 
a shallow furrow on each side of the smooth dorsal ridge. Apex, or mucro, 
of posterior valve so far back that it extends beyond the posterior margin 
of the eaves. Interior of valves bluish. Posterior valve about as wide as long 
and with 8 to 9 slits. Girdle with short, rigid spinelets mostly brown in 
color and with a few white ones intermingled. The girdle looks mossy. 
Moderately common. 

Nuttallina scahra Reeve Rough Nuttall Chiton

black and emerald-green, although sometimes having cream-orange bands 
on the sides of the valves. Sometimes grayish green with grayish black or 
white mottlings. Girdle colored yellowish brown to blackish brown. Valves 
slightly beaked; lateral area separated from the central area by a prominent, 
raised row of beads. Central areas with many coarse, wavy, longitudinal 
riblets, which are sometimes pitted between. Lateral areas coarsely granu- 
lated or wrinkled. Posterior valve small, with a deep slit on each side and 
a broad, deep notch at the very posterior end. Girdle fairly wide, generally 
notched at the posterior end and clothed with curly, strap-like brown hairs 
between which are much smaller, glassy white hairs or spicules. Interior 
of valves greenish white. Anterior valve granulated and with 8 to 9 coarse, 
raised rays of beads. A common intertidal species. The subspecies ivosnes- 
senski Middendorff (Alaska to Puget Sound) is supposed to be without the 
tiny white spicules in the girdle. 

Mopalia muscosa Gould Mossy Mopalia 

Alaska to Lower California. 

I to 2 inches in length, oblong to oval. Very similar to M. ciliata, but 
differing in having a very shallow and small notch at the very posterior 
end. Color usually a dull-brown, blackish olive or grayish. Interior of 
valves blue-green, rarely stained with pinkish. Girdle with stiff hairs resem- 
bling a fringe of moss. The following species have been considered by some 
workers as varieties of 7miscosa, and perhaps with some justification: lignosa 
Gould, hindsi Reeve, acuta Carpenter, the latter having also been named 
plumosa and fissa by Carpenter. A common intertidal species. 

Mopalia lignosa Gould Woody Mopalia 

Alaska to Lower California. 

I to 2^4 inches in length, oblong. Color a grayish green or blackish 
green, rarely with whitish cream and brown, feathery markings. The sculp- 
turing on the valves is very delicate and may consist only of numerous small 
pittings near the center. Concentric growth lines in smoother specimens are 
quite easily seen. Radial ribs absent on the end valves. Girdle solid or macu-

The shell is an elongate, curved tube open at both ends, and somewhat 
resembles an elephant's tusk. The diagnostic characters are the type of sculp- 
turing (ribs, riblets and circular threads or incised lines), the form of the 
apex, the degree of curvature, the size and thickness of shell and the position 
and form of the apical slit. The ten or so subgenera are nebulous in charac- 
ter and definition and one should consult the works of J. B. Henderson, 
H. A. PUsbry and W. H. Dall.

CHAPTER X 



Scallops, Oysters and 
Other Clams 

Class PELECYPODA 



The bivalves or clams are dwellers of fresh, marine or brackish waters. 
They lack a head and are without jaws or radular teeth; they are protected 
by a pair of shelly valves which are connected or hinged by a horny ligament 
and which are moved by the contraction of one to three muscles attached 
to the inner sides of the valves; feeding is usually done with the aid of their 
ciliated or hair-covered gills. Further details have been presented in the 
chapter on "The Life of the Clam." The class is also known as Lmnelli- 
branchia, Bivalvia or Acephala. The class may be divided into the follov/ing 
orders and suborders: 

Order PALAEOCONCHA

SOLEMYACIDAE 33 3 

Order PALAEOCONCHA 

Family SOLEMYACIDAE 

Genus Solemya Lamarck 1818 

The Awning Clams are very primitive in their characters and they have 
no near relatives. Their shells are fragile, with a weak, toothless hinge, 
gaping at both ends, and covered by a polished, horny, brown periostracum 
which extends well beyond the margins of the valves. 

Subgenus Petrasma Dall 1908 
Solemya velum Say Common Atlantic Awning Clam 

Plate 27a 

Nova Scotia to Florida. 

% to I inch in length, very fragile, and with a delicate, shiny, brown 
periostracum covering the entire shell and extending beyond the edges. Light 
radial bands of yellowish brown are present in some specimens. Chondro- 
phore supported by 2 curved arms. Commonly dredged in shallow water in 
mud bottom. Compare Florida specimens with occidentalis. 

Solemya bore alls Totten Boreal Awning Clam 

Nova Scotia to Connecticut. 

2 to 3 inches in length, very similar to velum, but more compressed, 
heavier, and colored grayish blue or lead on the inside of the valves (instead 
of purplish white). The striking difference is in the siphonal opening of the 
animal. In velum, there are 2 small, median, low tubercles above the opening 
and 5 or 6 pairs of short tentacles at the lower end of the opening. In bo- 
realis, there are 3 pairs (one of which is large and long) of tentacles above 
the opening and about 1 5 smaller ones bordering the lower half. S. borealis 
is moderately common offshore. 

Solemya occidentalis Deshayes West Indian Awning Clam 

West coast of Florida and the West Indies. 

^ inch in length, similar to S. velum, but much smaller, and has only 
one slender ridge or rib bordering the chondrophore. Uncommon just off- 
shore. Described first by Deshayes in 1857, later by Fischer in 1858.

NUCULANIDAE 3 39 

About H to % inch in length, shiny green-brown, with prominent con- 
centric sculpture and characterized by the nearly central umbones. Rostrum 
bluntly pointed, slightly upturned at the end. Concentric ribs disappear just 
anterior to the carinate border of the dorsal area which is strongly wrinkled. 
Adults over K' inch become quite fat. Commonly dredged off southern Cali- 
fornia in shallow water. Sorensen reports that this species is found com- 
monly in fish stomachs off Monterey. 

Nuculana penderi Dall and Bartsch Pender's Nut Clam

Periostracum light-brown. Moderately common offshore. 

Nuculana hindsi Hanley Hinds' Nut Clam 

Nazan Bay, Alaska, to Costa Rica. 

% inch in length, moderately elongate (example: 7.8 mm. long; 4.4 
mm. high; both valves 3.0 mm. wide); posterior end rostrate, slightly turned

bounded by smooth carinate rib. Sculpture of evenly sized, closely spaced, 
distinct, concentric ribs which become obsolete just before the rostral rib. 
Exterior light yellowish brown. Interior white with faint pearly sheen. N. 
acuta Conrad, a name often given to this Pacific Coast species, has its rostral 
rib crossed by concentric ribs. N. penderi Dall and Bartsch is twice as fat, 
with a very ovate lunule and is more rounded at the ventral margin. Hanley 
in i860 first reported this species from "Gulf of Nicoya, Costa Rica." This 
is probably "N. re don do en sis''"' "Burch" \\'oodring 1951. It is dredged com- 
monly off the West Coast from 1 5 to 600 fathoms.

Family ARCIDAE 

The ark shells have undergone intensive study in the last few years, and 
the nomenclature is still not settled. It is obvious, though, that not all of the 



342 American Seashelh 

arks can be placed under the single genus Area. The geological history and 
morphological studies force us to recognize three subfamilies. Many of the 
subgenera listed here are considered by some authorities as full genera. 1 
have refrained from defining their limits. 

Subfamily ARCINAE 
Genus Area Linne 1758 

Characterized by the long, narrow hinge line with numerous small teeth, 
by the large byssal notch on the ventral side, and the wide ligamental area 
between the beaks.

flecks and zebra-stripe markings of reddish brown. Periostracum brown, 
matted. Ribs of irregular sizes. No concentric riblets. Do not confuse with 
A. umbonata. A common species which attaches itself to rocks with its 
byssus. Used extensively in the shellcraft industry. Formerly A. oceiden- 
talis Philippi. 

Area wnbonata Lamarck Mossy Ark

beaded ribs and a very large byssal opening, usually having the posterior end 
much larger, and in lacking the zebra stripes. Periostracum sometimes quite 
heavy and foliated. Commonly attached to underside of rocks in shallow 
water.

^ to % inch in length, somewhat box-shaped, whitish in color and with 
no appreciable periostracum. Similar in shape and sculpture to Arcopsis 
adamsi, but instead of having a small, triangular ligament between the beaks, 
domingensis has a very narrow, long ligament posterior to the beaks. The 
posterior end is usually larger than the anterior end and characteristically 
dips slightly downward. Common at low tide under rocks. Erroneously 
called Area reticulata Gmelin by Dall and others (see Lamy and Woodring) . 

Barbatia bailyi Bartsch Baily's Miniature Ark 

Santa Monica, California, to Gulf of California. 

A little over ^ inch in length, oblong to squarish, fat; cancellate sculp- 
ture in which the beads become foliate at the posterior end. Ligament small, 
narrow and placed well posterior to the fairly close beaks; about 15 teeth. 
Color white to brownish white. 

Very common in certain localities under stones at low tide. A. pernoides 
Carpenter was thought to be this shell but is apparently some other much 
larger species of unknown identity.

faintly divided by a fine-cut line. Fine, raised, concentric lines seen between 
weakly beaded ribs. Left valve very slightly larger than right valve. Peri- 
ostracum light- to dark-brown. Not very common. 

Typical lienosa Say is fossil and very close in characters to floridana. 
This species has often been called A. secticostata Reeve which is not so 
elongate and whose origin is unknown.

species. 

Anadara transversa Say Transverse Ark 

Plate 27s 

South of Cape Cod to Florida and Texas. 

% to 1/4 inches in lengtli. Left valve overlaps right valve. Ligament 
fairly long, moderately narrow, rough or pustulose. Ribs on left valve usually 
beaded, rarely so on right valve; 30 to 35 ribs per valve. Periostracum gray- 
ish brown, usually wears off except along base of valves. Fairly common in 
mud below low water. The smallest of the Atlantic Anadaras. Distinguished 
from ovalis by its longer, wider, more distinct external ligament. A. sulcosa 
van Hyning 1 946 is this species. 

Subgenus Lunar ca Grav 1847 

The subgenera Argina Gray and Arginarca McLean 1951 are probably

ostracum black-brown, hairy. Ribs 26 to 35 in number. 

Dall considered the forms ''pexata Say" and ''americana Wood" too in- 
distinct for recognition. This species was known for a long time as cam- 
pechiensis Gmelin and is common.

Family PECTINIDAE 

Because of the great number of fossil and living species of scallops and 
the almost limitless modifications exhibited by them, there have been no 
less than 50 genera and subgenera proposed in this family by various authors. 
Doubtlessly, many more will be invented. Most, if not all, of these genera 
are closely integrated by connecting species. Workers have a choice of 
using the single genus, Pecteji, or employing a genus for nearly every species. 
We are arbitrarily employing only six genera — Pecte??, Aequipecten, Chla- 
772ys, Placopecten, Lyropecteii and Himiites — and we cannot justify these 
on biological grounds. It may be noted that we have moved the glassy, thin- 
shelled Propeamiisshim from the Pectinidae into a family of its own on 
anatomical grounds. This new family refers to what was once called "Amus- 
siidae." True Aumsiwn, however, is merely a subgenus of Pecteii connected 
to it by a series of species in the Euvola group.

each rib is composed of 3 rows of very fine, closely packed scales which 
are welded together to form a single rib. In cross-section, this would give 
the rib the shape of the letter M. Hinge-line straight with one ear slightly 
shorter than the other. Color dull-gray with indistinct blotches of dull- 
pink. Uncommonly dredged off Miama and the Lower Keys.

coast. It is not a very colorful species, although its drab browns and grays 
are rarely enhvened with yellow. There are 3 distinct subspecies which 
previously have been little understood. Each has a distinct geographical 
range and peculiar habitat. 

A. irradians irradians Lamarck. Nova Scotia to Long Island, N.Y. 17 to 
18 ribs which are low and roundish in cross-section. Each valve is about 
the same fatness, and the lower one is only slightly lighter in color. Drab 
gray-brown with indistinct, darker-brown mottlings. The most compressed 
of the 3 subspecies. This is borealis Say. 

A. irradians concentricus Say. New Jersey (rare), Virginia to Georgia 
and Louisiana to Tampa, Florida. 1 9 to 21 ribs which are squarish in cross- 
section. Lower valve (the lightest in color and commonly all white) is 
much fatter than the dull bluish gray to brown upper valve. Common. 

A. irradians ajnplico status Dall (fig. i6i). Central Texas to Mexico 
and Colombia. Similar to concentricus, but with only 12 to 17 ribs; more 
gibbose; lower valve commonly white and with high, squarish to slightly 
rounded ribs. Common in Texas. 

Aequipecten gib bus Linne Calico Scallop

quite square in cross-section. Bottom valve commonly whitish with a little 
color; upper valve can be of many bright hues (lavender-rose, red, whitish 
with purple or reddish mottlings, etc.). This is dislocatus Say. If collecting in 
southeast Florida, do not confuse with A, nucleus,

I to 1/4 inches in size. This is a difficult subspecies to identify, and 
it is possible that it is only a form. It is rarely over an inch in size, has i to 3 
more ribs than gibbus, is usually fatter, and is characteristically colored with 
small, chestnut mottlings on a cream background and commonly with snow- 
white specklings. Both or only one valve may be heavily colored. Never 
with the bright shades of orange, red, etc. Not uncommon in the Keys from 
low tide to a few fathoms on grass. 

Genus Hinnites Def ranee 1821 
Biologically speaking, this genus is really a Chlamys in which the adults 



SPONDYLIDAE 369 

are attached to rocks and become quite massive like Spojidyhis. For con- 
venience, we are considering it a full genus.

Up to 8 inches in length. A heavy massive shell characterized by the 
early "Chlamys-Hke" shell at the beaks. Interior white with a purplish hinge 
area. Attached to rocks by the right valve. The ^2-inch long young are 
almost impossible to separate from some species of Chlainys, except when 
they show a mauve spot on the inside of the hinge line on each side of the 
resilium pit, or if they show signs of distortion or a mottling pattern of 
color on the outside of the valves. Some vouno- are bright-orancre. A common 
species. Formerly known as H'mnites gigante7is Gray. This is a regrettable 
name change which I have followed, since leading workers on the Pacific 
Coast have adopted it.

SuperfavTily OSTREACEA 

Family OSTREIDAE 
Genus Ostrea Linne 1758 

This genus used to include all of the oysters, but today several valid 
genera are recognized, so that only three American species are included in 
true Ostrea. These are O. eqiiestris Say and O. permolUs Sowerby from the 
Atlantic Coast and O. hirida Carpenter from the Pacific Coast. The Euro- 
pean oyster, O. ediiUs Linne is also in this group. All of these oysters are 
relatively small. The eggs are fertilized and developed within the mantle 
chamber and gills. Usually around one million eggs are produced at one 
spawning. The prodissoconch hinge is long, the valves symmetrical. In the 
adults, the muscle scar is near the center of the shell and is not colored. 



Ostrea equestris Say Crested Oyster 

Plate 28c 

North Carolina, Florida, the Gulf States and West Indies. 

I to 2 inches in length, more or less oval, and with raised margins which 
are crenulated. The attached valve has a flat interior with a rather high, ver- 
tical margin on one side. Interior dull grayish with a greenish or opalescent- 
brown stain. Margin sometimes stained a weak-violet. Not very abundant 
except in some Florida bays. It lives in water that is much saltier than that 
in which virginica lives. Also named spreta Orbigny. O. cristata Born is 
quite different and is limited to South America.

sharply folded valve margins are characteristic of this intertidal species. Inner 
margins of valves closely dotted with minute pimples for nearly the entire 
circumference of the valves. Muscle scars located well up toward the hinge. 
Beaks somewhat curved. Interior translucent-white, exterior usually purplish 
red. Frequently elongate and attached to stems of trees by a series of clasp- 
ing projections of the shell, but may be also oval in shape. O. rubella and 
O. limacella Lamarck are this species. O. jolimn Linne is a Philippine species. 



374 American Seashells 

Ostrea permollis Sowerby Sponge Oyster 

Plate 28b 

North Carolina to Florida and the West Indies. 

Rarely over 3 inches in size. Lives embedded in sponges with only the 
margins of the valves showing. The surface of the valves has a soft, silky 
appearance. Beak twisted back into a strong spiral. Exterior light-orange to 
tan; interior white. Inner margins with numerous small, round denticles. 
Common. 

Another flat, but larger and light-shelled oyster, Pycnodonta hyotis 
Linne, is found in deep water attached to old wrecks off Florida and in the 
West Indies. It is immediately recognized by the peculiar structure of the 
shell which under a lens appears to be filled with numerous bubbles or empty 
cells, much like a bath sponge. It reaches a diameter of 3 or 4 inches, is 
generally circular in outline and may be colored whitish cream, brownish or 
even lavender. Ostrea thovmsi McLean is this species according to the French 
worker, Gilbert Ranson. 

Ostrea lurida Carpenter Native Pacific Oyster

exterior. This is the common intertidal native species of the Pacific Coast. 
A number of ecological forms have been described: expansa Carpenter, 
rufoides Cpr. and possibly conchaphila Cpr. 

Genus Crassostrea Sacco 1897 

This genus includes the commercially important American Oyster, C. 
virginica Gmehn, which was formerly placed in the genus Ostrea. In 
Crassostrea, the left or attached valve is larger than the right. The inner 
margin is smooth. The eggs are small, produced in large numbers at one 
spawning (over 50 million), and are fertilized and develop in the open wa- 
ters outside of the parents. The muscle scar is usually colored. The prodisso- 
conch hinge is short, and the valves asymmetrical. The Japanese Oyster (C. 
gigas)^ introduced to west American shores, the Portuguese Oyster (C angu- 
lata Lamarck), and C. rhizophorae Guilding from Cuba also belong to this 
genus. Gryphaea Lamarck is a fossil genus which should not be associated 
with this genus.

Plate 28a 

Gulf of St. Lawrence to the Gulf of Mexico and the West Indies. 

2 to 6 inches in length. This is the familiar edible oyster which varies 
greatly in size and shape. The valve margins are only slightly undulating or 
are straight. The muscle scar is usually colored a deep purple, the rest of the 
shell being white inside and dirty-gray exteriorly. Beaks usually long and 
strongly curved. "Blue Points," a form originally harvested at Blue Point, 
Long Island, are rounded in shape and with a rather deep, lower valve. 
"Lynnhavens" arc broad, elongate forms originally harvested at Lynnhaven 
Bay, Virginia. These variations are due to environmental differences. C. 
brasiliana Lamarck and C. floridensis Sowerby are this species. 

Crassostrea rhizophorae Guilding (brasiliana of authors) is found in the 
Caribbean region, and it is a lightweight shell, deep-cupped, with a flat upper 
valve small and fitting well down into the lower valve. The inner margin of 
the lower, attached valve is splotched with bluish purple. Common. 

Crassostrea gigas Thunberg Giant Pacific Oyster 

Plate 29g 
British Columbia to California. Japan. 

3 to 12 inches in length, of various shapes, but generally characterized 
by its large size, its coarse, widely spaced, concentric lamellae or very coarse 
longitudinal flutings or ridges on the outside. Interior enamel white, often 
with a faint purplish stain on the muscle scar or near the edges of the shell. 
Very rarely with a greenish stain. A common, large and marketable oyster 
introduced yearly into Canada and the United States from Japan. The form 
lapermisi Schrenck is round. The typical gigas is the long, strap-like form. 
O. gigas Aleuschen is an invalid name and does not preoccupy that of Thun- 
berg's. Also known as the Japanese Oyster.

In live material, the gray periostracum obscures the color of the shell. Ex- 
terior whitish to gray with small bars of chestnut color on the ribs arranged 
in concentric series. Interior white with a small light-brown patch above 
the two muscle scars. Beaks close together. Lunule small, very deeply in- 
dented under the beaks. Ligament moderately large, visible from the out- 
side. Very common on the west coast of Florida where it is washed ashore. 
Used extensively in the jewelry business. 

Cardita gracilis Shuttleworth is doubtfully recorded from Florida but is 
known from Mexico to Puerto Rico. It is quite elongate, narrow at the 
anterior end, with larger, smoothish ribs, and the posterior lateral tooth is 
stained dark-brown. Uncommon. 

The Pacific Coast species is Cardita carpenteri Lamy (pi. 29r) which is

2 to 4 inches in length, very similar to A. alba, but with a more chalky 
shell, never with orange color, interior usually pustulose, and the long, an- 
terior muscle scar juts away from the pallial line at an angle of about 30 
degrees instead of paralleling it as in alba. An uncommon species, commonly 
confused with alba. It lives down to 50 fathoms but at times is washed ashore. 
A, schrammi Crosse is this species. 

Genus Codakia Scopoli 1777 

Shell large, orbicular, moderately compressed. Hinge of right valve with 
a prominent anterior lateral which is typically close to the cardinals (an an- 
terior, a posterior and a middle cardinal). Hinge of left valve with a large 
double anterior lateral, only 2 cardinals, and with a small, double posterior 
lateral.

2 % to 3 % inches in length, slightly less in height, well-compressed, more 
or less orbicular in outline, thick and strong. Beaks and /4 inch of subsequent 
growth smoothish. Remainder of the shell roughly sculptured by numerous 
coarse radial threads which are crossed by finer concentric threads. This 
commonly gives the radial ribs a beaded appearance. Exterior white. Inte- 
rior white to pale-lemon, commonly with a rose tinge on the ends of the 
hinge or along the margins of the valves. Lunule jusf in front of the beaks 
is deep, heart-shaped, small and nearly all on the right valve. A common trop- 
ical species. Do not confuse with C. orbiculata. 

Codakia costata Orbigny Costate Lucina 

North Carolina to southeast Florida and the West Indies. 

/4 inch in length, variable in shape, but usually orbicular, quite obese, 
white to yellowish in color. With fine radial ribs, usually in pairs which are 
crossed by very fine concentric threads. Beaks also* with this sculpturing. 
Lunule small, indistinct, lanceolate, slightly more on the right valve. Com- 
pare its poorly defined lunule with those of orbicidaris and orbiculata. Mod- 
erately common offshore on sandy bottoms.

elongate lunule in front of the beaks (instead of small and heart-shaped), and 
with stronger, less numerous, commonly divaricate ribs which are noticeable 
right up to the ends of the beaks. This species is much fatter and never has 
pink coloring inside. Common in sand from low water to 100 fathoms. 

The form filiata Dall has finer sculpturing much like orbicidaris, is often 
yellowish in color, but can be readily distinguished from the latter by its 
elongate lunule. Common in the Gulf of Mexico.

Chama vmcerophylla Gmelin Leafy Jewel Box 

Plate 37b-, figure 79b 

North Carolina to southeast Florida and the West Indies. 

This is the most common and most brightly hued Atlantic species. In 
quiet waters it may develop spine-like foliations to such an extent that it 
resembles the Spiny Oyster, Spondylus. Exterior variously colored: lemon- 
yellow, reddish brown, deep- to dull-purple, orange, white, or a combination 
of these colors. Inner edges of the valves have tiny, axial ridges or crenula- 
tions. The scale-like fronds have minute radial lines. Compare with sinuosa.

Rarely over i inch in size. This species closely resembles the common 
J77acerophylla, but in place of numerous foliations there are low axial corru- 
gations or wavy cords. The unattached valve may have a few short, flat 
spines. There are fine crenulations on the inner margins of the valves. The 
color is usually dull with darker specklings. In rocky areas they live in crev- 
ices and under stones. Commonly found attached to pen and ark shells.

Similar to pellucida, but attached by the right valve which, when viewed 
from the inside, is arched counterclockwise. The opaque whitish area inside 
is generally not bordered by tiny crenulations. A common intertidal species. 

Pseudochavia echinata Broderip in the Gulf of California is a popular 
shell which is characterized by a watermelon-red hinge and purple-stained 
interior. 

Pseudochama grajiti Strong (Grant's Chama), dredged off central Cali- 
fornia and Catalina Island, is about i inch in size, with prickly spines on the 
underside of the attached, cup-formed valve. One end of the valve is tinted

Lunule distinct and broadly heart-shaped. With 7 to 9 rows of moderately 
long, stoutish spines, between which the shell is grossly pitted. Exterior 
creamy-white; interior white or flushed with bright pinkish mauve. Attached 
to a small pebble or broken shell by the right valve. Common from 3 to 
40 fathoms, and commonly washed ashore. 

Echinochama arcinella Linne (True Spiny Jewel Box, pi. 37h) from the 
West Indies to Brazil has 16 to 35 (commonly 20) radial rows of slender 
spines. The shell is not as obese nor as heavy as cornuta. The subspecies 
calif orjiica Dall (pi. 37e) is very similar, with slightly longer spines and with 
a more compressed shell. It ranges from the Gulf of CaHfornia to Panama 
in offshore water. 

Superfamily LEPTONACEA 
Family LEPTONIDAE 

A group of small, fragile, inflated, translucent clams which are parasitic

round and slightly gaping at the posterior end. Exterior brownish gray 
and may be with brown, concentric rings of growth. Interior dull-white. 
Beaks inflated and high. Ligament large and strong. No lunule or escutcheon. 
Weak radial ribs seen at both ends only. Concentric growth ridges promi- 
nent near the margins. Muscle scars and pallial line deeply impressed. Foot 
of animal large and suffused with heavy, red mottlings. Very commonly 
dredged in cold, northern waters. 

Genus Clinocardium Keen 1936 
Clinocardhim ciliatuvt Fabricius Iceland Cockle 

Plate 320 

Greenland to Massachusetts. Alaska to Puget Sound, Washington. 

1/4 to 3 inches in size, a little longer than high, with 32 to 38 ridged 
radial ribs which are crossed by coarse concentric lines of growth. Exter- 
nally drab grayish yellow with weak, narrow, concentric bands of darker 
color. Interior ivory. Periostracum gray and conspicuous. Especially abun- 
dant from Maine northward in offshore waters. 

Clinocardium nuttalli Conrad Nuttall's Cockle 

Plate 31b 

Bering Sea to San Diego, California. 

2 to 6 inches in length; smaller ones being almost round, adults tending 
to be higher than long; moderately compressed; commonly with 33 to 37 
coarse radial ribs which are creased by half-moon-shaped riblets. Older 
specimens worn smoothish. Exterior drab-gray, with a brownish yellow, 
thin periostracum. Common offshore. Once called C. corbis Martyn. Known 
locally as the Basket Cockle. 

Clinocardiimi fucanum Dall Fucan Cockle 

Sitka, Alaska, to oif Monterey, California. 

I to 1/4 inches in length, longer than high, moderately inflated, and 
with 45 to 50 low, poorly developed, radial ribs which are crossed by mi- 
croscopic concentric lines. No wavy, radial furrow on the upper posterior 
edge of the shell. Color whitish with a grayish-brown periostracum. Com- 
mon in the Puget Sound area. 

Young C. nuttalli are distinguished from this species by their 2 first ribs 
behind the ligament which are large, rounded and make a wavy edge to the 
shell. In small specimens of C. ciliatmn, the top edges of the ribs are sharp; 
in jucanuvi they are rounded.

Plate 30c 

Labrador to off North CaroHna. 

^ to /4 inch in length, thin, with 22 to 28 wide, flat ribs which have 
delicate, arched scales on the anterior slope of the shell. Scales missing on 
the central portion of the valve. Externally cream; interior glossy and white, 
rarely tinted with orange-brown. Commonly dredged from 7 to 100 fathoms. 

Super jamily VENERACEA 
Family VENERIDAE 

The classification of the family of Venus clams has been one of continual 
debate and rearranging for some years. Our presentation here is no better 
than has been suggested before, but at least it is in a form which is conserva- 
tive and most likely to be accepted by the majority. Rather than accept a 
separate family Chionidae or consider it a subfamily remotely related to the 
Venerinae, we have allied it as an artificial group in the subfamily Venerinae. 
I suspect that an anatomical study of the soft parts will support this course. 

Siibfamily VENERINAE 

Sculpture usually both radial and concentric; anterior lateral present, 
especially in the left valve, but often extraordinarily vestigial. 

Genus Antigona Schumacher 1817 
Subgenus Dosina Gray 1835 

Antigona listen Gray Princess Venus 

Plate 32m 

Southeast Florida and the West Indies. 

2 to 4 inches in length, oblong-oval, obese. Resembling Mercejiaria 
campechiensis, but characterized by numerous, fine, radial riblets which cause 
the sharp, concentric ribs to be serrated or beaded. Each side of the lunule 
is bounded by a long, deep, narrow furrow. Posterior muscle scar usually 
stained brown. Moderately common in shallow water in sand.

1% inches in length, externahy very much hke a small Mercenaria 
campechiensis, but not as elongate and with more distinct, concentric riblets. 
Internally, it is distinguished easily by the extremely small, if not absent, 
pallial sinus, by the very thick margin of the shell, and in the left valve by 
the presence of a button-like anterior lateral "tooth." Exterior whitish. 
Dredged occasionally from 40 to 70 fathoms. Considered a collector's item.

North Carolina to southeast Florida and the West Indies. 

I to i^ inches in length, rather circular, inflated, and characterized by 
strong, raised, lamellate, concentric ribs between which are 5 or 6 smaller, 
raised concentric ridges. Lunule heart-shaped, well-impressed, bordered by 
a fine, deep line, and crossed by numerous raised threads. Escutcheon well- 
formed, smoothish. Color cream to whitish with light-mauve mottlings. 
Very uncommon. 

Antigona rigida Dillwyn from the West Indies is very similar, but 
not nearly so obese, and its concentric ridges are stronger and smoother. 

^^Chiojiid" Group 

Ovate-trigonal, inequilateral, sculpture usually cancellate; lunule im- 
pressed. Inner margins usually crenulate. Teeth strong, without the tiny, 
pimple-like anterior lateral. Pallial sinus short. This section or group is 



406 Ainerican Seashells 

considered by some to be of family or subfamily rank. See Frizzell and Myra 
Keen. 

Genus Mercenaria Schumacher 1817 

The Hard-shell Clams or Quahogs belong to this genus. The shell is 
large and thick; lunule large, heart-shaped and bounded by an incised line. 
Inner margin crenulate. 3 cardinals in each valve. Left middle cardinal 
split. Formerly placed in the genus Venus many years ago, but almost 
universally placed in a genus by itself by modern workers. 

Mercenaria mercenaria Linne Northern Quahog 

Plate 32h 

Gulf of St. Lawrence to Florida and the Gulf of Mexico. 
Introduced to Humboldt Bay, California. 

3 to 5 inches in length, ovate-trigonal, about % as high, heavy and quite 
thick. Moderately inflated. Sculpture of numerous, concentric lines of 
growth or small riblets. Near the beaks these lines are prominent and dis- 
tantly spaced. The exterior center of the valves has a characteristic smoothish 
or glossy area. Exterior dirty-gray to whitish; interior white, commonly 
with purple stainings. The entire lunule is % as wide as long. The form 
notata Say from the same region is externally marked with brown, zie^ag 
mottlings. This species is very common and is used commercially for 
chowders and as clams-on-the-half-shell or "cherrystones." Also known as 
the Hard-shelled Clam. Do not confuse with M. caTnpechiensis. 

Mercenaria mercenaria texana Dall is a subspecies from the northern 
Gulf of Mexico region. It is characterized by a glossy central area on the 
outside of the shell, but has large, irregular, coalescing, flat-topped, con- 
centric ribs. 

Mercenaria campechiensis Gmelin Southern Quahog 

Plate 32g 

Chesapeake Bay to Florida, Texas and Cuba. 

3 to 6 inches in length, very similar to mercenaria, but much more obese, 
a heavier shell, lacks the smooth central area on the outside of the valves, 
and the entire lunule is usually as wide as long. Always white internally. 
Rarely it has a purplish stain on the escutcheon and brown mottlings on the 
side. There have been a number of forms described. In the vicinity of St. 
Petersburg, Florida, there is a malformed race in which there is a sharp, 
elevated ridge passing from the umbo obliquely backward toward the pallial 
sinus on the inside of each valve. The Southern Quahog is common but 
has not been exploited commercially to any great extent. 



VENERIDAE 407 

Genus Chione Miihlfeld 1811 

Shells trigonal or ovate; thick; 3 cardinal teeth in each valve; no anterior 
laterals; pallial sinus small and triangular; inner margins crenulated; lunule 
bounded by an indented line; escutcheon smooth and bounded by a small 
ridge. 

Subgenus Chione s. str. 
Chiojie cancellata Linne Cross-barred Venus 

Plate 39h 

North Carolina to Florida, Texas and the West Indies. 

I to I % inches in length, varying from ovate to subtriangular in shape, 
thick; with strong, raised, curved, leaf-like, concentric ribs and numerous 
coarse radial ribs. Escutcheon long, smooth and V-shaped, commonly with 
6 to 7 brown, zebra-stripes. Lunule heart-shaped, with minute vertical 
threads. Color externally is white to gray; internally glossy-white with a 
suffusion of purplish blue. A very common, shallow-water species in Florida. 
Beachworn specimens have a cancellate sculpturing. The subspecies mazycki 
Dall, off the Carolinas, Georgia and northeast Florida has a beautiful rosy 
interior.

Plate 39g 

North Carolina, the Gulf States to the West Indies. 

1 to I ^ inches both ways, thick, glossy-white to cream; interior white, 
commonly with a violet, radial band or splotch at the posterior third. Ex- 
terior with crowded, smooth, low, rounded, concentric ribs. The lower 
edge of these ribs bears many small bars which are Imed up one below the 
other to give the shell the impression that it has axial ribs. The concentric 
ribs become sharp and higher at the shell's extreme ends. Lunule with 
raised lamellations; escutcheon with very fine, transverse lines. Uncommon. 
Incorrectly spelled interpurpurea.

rather wide, rounded, radial riblets. Lunule heart-shaped and striated; es- 
cutcheon V-shaped in cross-section, long and smooth. The dorsal posterior 
end of the right valve is not as smooth and overlaps the left valve. Exterior

creamy-white with faint mauve stripes on the escutcheon. Interior white, 
commonly with a purple splotch at the posterior end. This is a common 
shore species, formerly called C. succincta Val. 

Chione calif orniensis undatella Sowerby Frilled Californian Venus 

Plate 3ii 

San Pedro, California, to northern South America. 

Differing from calif orniensis in being more inflated, usually with more 
numerous and more closely spaced, thinner concentric ribs, and retaining 
mauve-brown color splotches in the adults. Very common. Aiany workers 
consider this a full species, and apparently additional field study is necessary. 

Chione fluctifraga Sowerby Smooth Pacific Venus 

Plate 31k

lYo inches in height, slightly longer, moderately compressed, subtrigonal; 
radial grooves or ribs strong at the posterior third and at the anterior quarter 
of the shell; central area with stronger, low, rather wide, concentric ribs which 
may have coarse, half-moon-shaped beads. Lunule not well-defined; escutch- 
eon not well seen and not sunken nor smooth as in calif orniensis. Exterior 
creamy-white, semi-glossy, rarely stained with blue-gray. Interior white 
with purple splotches near the muscle scars or on the teeth. Not uncommon 
along the sandy shores in southern localities.

briated and overlapping the left valve. Lunule narrow, heart-shaped, colored 
brown. Escutcheon very narrow and sunken. Exterior colored a dull-gray, 
but some Florida specimens tend to be whitish, pinkish or even orange. In- 
terior glossy-white with purplish brown area at the posterior end. Pnrple

Beaks tiny and inrolled. Sculpture of small, but distinct, rounded, concentric 
ribs which are more prominent near the beaks. Color variable: glossy-cream, 
white or tan with brown or purple rays of fine specklings. Interior white, 
purple or brown. Brackish water specimens are dwarfed. A common sandy 
shore species. 

A. brasiliana Gmelin (West Indian Pointed Venus) which is twice as

in shallow water in sand and commonly washed ashore. 

West Indian collectors should not confuse this species with Strigilla 
rombergi Morch (southeast Florida, the Bahamas to Lesser Antilles) which 
is very similar, except that the upper line of the pallial sinus does not reach 
the anterior muscle scar. The radial cut lines are more numerous and more 
curved in rombergi. Common.

peculiar Strigillid sculpturing which is very similar to that in 5. pisiforinis 
(the radial cut lines meet the ventral margin of the valves at an angle of 
about 45 degrees). The pallial line runs forward from the posterior muscle 
scar but does not reach the anterior muscle scar as it does in pisiforutis. 
Common. Do not confuse with the larger Divaricella qiiadrisulcata (page 
391) which has fine denticulations on the inner margins of the valves. 
5. flexuosa Say 1822 is preoccupied by Montagu 1803 and Turton 1807,

more inflated. The pink color inside is concentrated in the deepest part of 
the valve, and the margins are usually white. The radial, oblique cut lines 
meet the ventral margin of the valve at about 45 degrees angle, while in 
carnaria the Hnes are almost vertical. This is a very abundant species, es- 
pecially in the Bahamas where they are gathered in great numbers and 
brought to Florida for use in the shellcraft business.

2 to 4 inches in length. This is the largest Macoma in America and is 
characterized by the almost flat left valve, rather well-inflated right valve, 
and by the wide and relatively short ligament which is sunk partially into 
the shell. There is a large, oblique, rib-like extension just behind the hinge 
inside each valve. Color cream to white. Common in bays and beaches from 
shore to 25 fathoms. A small form occurs in protected waters in bays in its 
more southerly range. 

Students of the Pacific Coast fauna consider M. indentata Carpenter 
(same range) as a distinct species in which the shell is 1% inches in length, 
a little more elongate, with a more pointed posterior end, and with a slight 
indentation on the posterior ventral margin. It may possibly be a form of 
young secta. M. teniiirostris Dall is even more elongate and may also be a 
form.

margins sloping down from the beaks. Color pale purple inside and out. 
Periostracum yellowish brown and finely wrinkled. Moderately common in 
shallow water in sandy mud. 

Tagehis politiis Carpenter from Central America does not slope down 
from the beaks so strongly, is a thinner shell and much more darkly colored 
with violet. 

Genus Meter odonax Morch 1853 

Shell less than i inch in length, resembling a strong, oval Tellina. Two 
cardinals and two lateral teeth in each valve, the laterals usually not very 
distinct. Pallial sinus extends % the length of the shell.

in each valve. Anterior to the beaks (which point forward), the hinge is 
thick for a short distance, then followed by a thinner, concave portion. Color 
variable: white with 2 oblong crimson spots inside; violet with radial streaks; 
pink, yellow or mauve; some are speckled with black or brown. This is a 
common species found with Donax on the slopes of sandy beaches. H. pa- 
cificiis Conrad is a synonym.

ately elongate. Shell whitish tan, with broad, indistinct, radial rays of darker 
tan or rosy purplish. Periostracum thin, ohve-green and varnish-like. Mod- 
erately common in sand at low tide to 25 fathoms. This species can be 
distinguished from the young of S. patula by its narrower and higher internal 
rib which crosses the shell at right-angles, and in being more arcuate on its 
ventral margin.

4 to 5 inches in length, similar to panda, but chalky-white inside, more 
truncate at both ends, a heavier shell, and with a stronger, narrower and 
vertical (not oblique) rib on the inside. 5. viedia Sowerby from the same 
region may possibly be the young of this species, although it is blushed with 
purple inside. 5. alta is common and edible. 

Genus Ensis Schumacher 1817 

The Jackknife Clams closely resemble Solen, but the left valve has 2 
vertical, cardinal teeth, and each valve has a long, low posterior tooth. 

Eiisis directus Conrad Atlantic Jackknife Clam

ish-green periostracum. Common on sand-flats in New England. Edible. 

Ensis minor Dall from both sides of Florida to Texas rarely exceeds 3 
inches in length, is more fragile, relatively longer, and is more pointed at 
the free end (not the end with the teeth). Internally it has purplish stains. 
Moderately common between tide marks. Some workers consider this a sub- 
species of directus. E. megistus Pilsbry and McGinty are probably 5 -inch- 
long specimens of minor.

Up to 3/4 inches in length, similar to calif ornica, but more oval at the 
ventral margin, without concentric undulations on the beaks, and with 2 very 
distinct, raised, radial ridges on the posterior dorsal margin. The whitish 
shell is glossy and the periostracum is shiny and yellowish tan. Not very 
common. 

Genus Spisula Gray 1837 

Spisiila soUdissima Dillwyn Atlantic Surf Clam 

Plate 32P 
Nova Scotia to South Carolina. 

Up to 7 inches in length (usually about 4 or 5 inches), strong, oval and 
smoothish, except for small, irregular growth lines. The lateral teeth bear 
very tiny, saw-tooth ridges. Color yellowish white with a thin yellowish 
brown periostracum. Common below low-water mark on ocean beaches. 
After violent winter storms, these clams are cast ashore in incredible num- 
bers, some estimates giving an approximate count of 50 million clams along 
a ten-mile stretch. 

The subspecies shnilis Say (Cape Cod to both sides of Florida and to 
Texas) is more elongate, its anterior slope flatter, and its pallial sinus longer 
and not sloping slightly upward. In the left valve, the tiny double tooth, 
just anterior to the spoon-shaped chondrophore, is usually much larger and 
stronger. Moderately common, and commonly existing with the typical spe- 
cies in the northern part of its range. Compare with polynyma which has a 
larger pallial sinus.

the dorsal and ventral margins usually parallel to each other. A posterior 
gape may be present. Beaks close together, about % back from the anterior 
end. Just behind them is a conspicuous, bean-shaped, external ligament. 
Shell chalky, white and with coarse, irregular growth lines. Periostracum 
gray, thin and usually flakes oif in dried specimens. With a weak or fairly 
strong radial rib at the posterior end. The rib may be scaled. Common in 
cold water. This is H. rugosa Linne and pholadis Linne. 

■ Hiatella striata Fleuriau {H. galUcana Lamarck and rugosa of some 
authors) is almost indistinguishable in the adult form from arctic a. The 
young, however, in striata do not have the two radial spinose ribs. This 
species breeds in winter, while arctica breeds in summer. The eggs are pinkish 
cream, while those of arctica are red. It nearly always bores into stone. 

Genus Cyrtodaria Daudin 1799 
Cyrtodaria siliqiia Spengler Northern Propeller Clam 

Labrador to Rhode Island. 

2 to 3 inches in length, about H as high. Gapes at both ends, but more 
so posteriorly where the large siphonal snout projects out about an inch. 
Beaks hardly noticeable, placed slightly toward the anterior end. The 
strong, wide ligament is external at the very anterior end of the dorsal mar- 
gin. Shell chalky, white with a bluish tint. The valves are thick-shelled, with 
a coarse callus inside. The valves are slightly twisted in propeller fashion. 
Hinge a simple bar with a fairly large bulbous swelling under the ligament. 
In life, the periostracum is light-brown, glossy, smooth and covers the en- 
tire exterior. Dried valves soon lose the flaky, blackened periostracum. 
Moderately common offshore down to 90 fathoms. On occasion, found in 
fish stomachs. 

A similar species, Cyrtodaria kurriana Dunker, is found in arctic waters 
along the shores at low tide. It is 3 times as long as high, hardly twisted 
and rarely exceeds 1% inches in length. Uncommon in collections.

7 to 9 inches in length. Inflated, sHghtly elongate and rather thick- 
shelled. Gaping at both ends. Coarse, concentric, wavy sculpture present, 
especially noticeable near the small, central, depressed beaks. Periostracum 
thin and yellowish. Exterior of shell dirty-white to cream; interior semi- 
glossy and white. Hinge with a single, large, horizontal thickening. The 
2 long, united siphons of the animal are half the weight of the entire clam. 
Common in mud 2 or 3 feet deep in the northwestern states. Edible but 
tough. Freaks have been named soJida Dall, globosa Dall and taeiiiata Dall. 
For an interesting and well-illustrated account of this species, see Natural 
History Magazine (N.Y.), April, 1948, on "We Go Gooeyducking" by the

to U-shaped in truncata. Shell eHiptical. Periostracum very thin and light- 
gray to straw. Chondrophore in left valve long, spoon-shaped and shallow. 
M. japonica Jay of the Pacific coast is probably this speices. This common, 
delectable clam, also known as the long-necked clam, steamer and nanny 
nose, is harvested from the readily accessible mud flats of New England in 
great numbers. In 1935, nearly 12 million pounds, valued at $704,000, were 
taken from our eastern shores. A hundred pounds of clams furnishes 35 
pounds of meat, while the equivalent weight of oysters would give only 13 
pounds.

It is also a food for the walrus, king eider duck, arctic fox and the codfish. 
It is uncommon in American collections. 

Genus Spheuia Turton 1822 

Shell small and fragile; surface with concentric ridges; hinge-teeth ab-

fatter. Right beak crowds slightly over the left beak. Posterior gape very 
small. Chondrophore in left valve large, tucks against a small, concave shelf 
under the right beak. Exterior chalky and with small growth lines. Peri- 
ostracum dull-gray, faintly and radially striped at the posterior end. Interior 
slightly nacreous in fresh specimens. Common in sand where it may live as 
deep as 20 inches. The short siphons enter the burrows of other marine 
animals.

elongate, smaller, less obese and with numerous but weaker ridges. Color 
white, but some may be tinted with rose near the margins. Uncommonly 
dredged from 12 to 250 fathoms. Live specimens very rare. This is C. dis- 
parilis of authors. 

Genus Corbula Bruguiere 1792 

Small, thick shells characterized by one valve (commonly the right) 
being larger than the other. Posterior end commonly rostrate. Resilium 
and ligament internal. The genus Aloidis Aliihlfeld was in current use until 
recently. 

Corhila contracta Say Contracted Corbula 

Cape Cod to Florida and the West Indies.

about the same size, except that the posterior, ventral margin of the right 
valve overlaps that of the left. The numerous, poorly defined, concentric 
ridges on the outside of the valves extend over the posterior, radial ridge on 
to the posterior slope. The left valve has a V-shaped notch in the hinge 
just anterior to the beak. Color dirty-gray. A common shallow-water 
species.

6 to I GO fathoms. 

Corbiila luteola Carpenter Common Western Corbula 

Monterey, California, to Panama. 

% inch in length, slightly obese, with the right valve more obese and 
overlapping the left valve on the ventral margin. Anterior end elliptical 
in outhne; posterior end coming to a blunt point. Beaks strong, close to- 
gether and slightly nearer the posterior end. Shell porcellaneous, whitish 
gray and may be flushed with pinkish or purplish. Interior whitish, but 
commonly yellowish with purple-red staining. Sculpture of weak, concen- 
tric crrowth lines which are less noticeable toward the smoothish beaks. 
Common in some localities in sand and rocky, rubbly beaches to 25 fathoms. 
C. rosea Williamson is merely a pink color phase of this species. 

Corbula porcella Dall Ribbed Western Corbula 

Santa Rosa Island, California, to Panama. 

V4 to Ys inch in length, similar to luteola, but much fatter, chalky, gray, 
and with much stronger concentric riblets. The right valve overlaps the left 
valve very prominently on the ventral margin. Moderately common from 
shallow water to 53 fathoms. 

Fa7nily GASTROCHAENIDAE 
Genus ROCELLARIA Blainville 1828 

Both valves fairly thin, somewhat chalky in substance, and equal in size 
and shape. The anterior gape is very large. Beaks very near the anterior end. 
Hinge-teeth obscure. These clams form flask-shaped excavations in the rocks 
which they line with calcareous material. When not protected by a burrow, 
they form a shelly tube to which debris is attached. Gastrochaena Spengler 
is another genus from the Indo-Pacific area (formerly Fistula7ia Brug., not 
Miiller) . 

Rocellaria hians Gmelin Atlantic Rocellaria 

North Carolina to Texas and the West Indies. 

% to % inch in length; valves rather spathate, with low, indistinct, fine, 
concentric ridges. Posterior end large and rounded. The entire anterior- 
ventral end is widely open to accommodate the foot. Color white. Common 



460 American Se ash ells 

in soft coral rocks. Erroneously called c7meifor77iis Spengler which is an 
Indo-Pacific species (see E. Lamy, 1924). 

Rocellaria ovata Sowerby (Bermuda and the Atlantic Coast, rare) is 
very similar, but the beaks are at the very end of the valve, and the shell is 
more elongate. In hians, there is a very small, wing-like projection of the 
valve in front of the beak. 



Genus Spengleria Tryon 1861 

Similar to Rocellaria, but truncate at the posterior end where there are 
strong, concentric ribs. Beaks at the anterior third of the shell. 

Spengleria rostrata Spengler Atlantic Spengler Clam 

Southeast Florida and the West Indies. 

I inch in length; valve truncate at the posterior end. There is a very 
characteristic, elevated, triangular area which radiates from the beaks to the 
large, posterior end. This area is crossed by strong, transverse lamellations 
resembling a washboard. Commonly found boring in soft coral rock. Un- 
common in Florida. 

Superfamily ADESMACEA 
Family PHOLADIDAE 

Pending publication of the extensive researches on this group by Dr. 
Ruth D, Turner at Harvard University, we are dividing the groups in this 
family and treating the species in the conventional manner. 

Genus Cyrtopleiira Tryon 1862 
Barnea costata Linne Angel Wing 

Figure 94a 

Massachusetts to Florida, Texas and the West Indies. 

4 to 8 inches in length, moderately fragile; pure white in color, but in 
life covered by a thin, gray periostracum. With about 30 well-developed, 
beaded radial ribs which are scale-like at the anterior end of the valve. In 
fresh material, there is a shelly accessory plate over the hinge area. It is 
somewhat triangular and with complicated furrows. The internal brace 
under the beaks is spoon-shaped and with a narrow, strongly hooked at- 
tached end. Common in sticky mud about a foot under the surface (con- 
sult "Diggin' 'Em Out" by B. R. Bales, The Nautilus, vol. 59, pp. 13 to 17). 
Some colonies have shells which have pink, concentric stains on the inside of

Barnea truncata Say Fallen Angel Wing 

Massachusetts Bay to south Florida. 

2 to 2/4 inches in length, somewhat resembling the Angel Wing, B. 
costata, but widely gaping at both ends, truncate at the posterior end, 
smoothish at the posterior half, and with an elongate, narrow accessory 
plate over the beak area. Shell fragile, white to grayish white. The internal 
condyle is long and about the thickness of a toothpick. The siphons are 
encased in a large, rough, gray, tubular sheath which may be extended 2 to 
3 times the length of the shell. Bores into clay, soft rock or wood. Common 
in intertidal zones. Do not confuse with Zirfaea crispata which is much 
more squat and has a radial, indented line dividing each valve into 2 areas. 

Barnea siibtnmcata Sowcrby 1834 Pacific Mud Piddock 

San Francisco, California, to Lower California. 



462 American Se ash ells 

2 to 2^4 inches in length, very elongate, moderately gaping at the bluntly 
rounded, posterior end, and widely gaping at the foot end. Top margin 
of shell folded back on itself at, and just anterior to, the beaks. No distinct 
radial groove on the sides of the valves. Sculpture at anterior end is of prickly, 
concentric lamellae which fade out toward the smoothish posterior third. 
Siphon covered with a heavy, brown periostracum. May be dug out of 
very soft shale at very low tides in a few localities. Moderately common. 
Miss Turner advises me that this species must take the earlier name of Barnea 
spathidata Deshayes. It was formerly known as B. pacifica Stearns. 

Genus Zirfaea Gray 1842 
Zirfaea crispata Linne Great Piddock 

Figure 94c 

Newfoundland to New Jersey. Europe. 

1 to 2 inches in length, about half as high. Gaping at both ends. Charac- 
terized by the radial, indented line which divides the valves into 2 areas: the 
posterior section which has coarse, irregular growth lines, and the anterior 
section which has fimbriated or scaled growth lines and a serrated edge. 
A4oderately common in cold water where it burrows into soft r^ck. This is 
the only member of the genus on the Atlantic Coast. 

Zirfaea pilsbryi Lowe Pacific Rough Piddock 

Bering Sea to San Diego, California. 

2 to 4 inches in length, gaping at both ends. Purportedly there are no 
accessory plates present, except for a small mesoplax. The folded-back dorsal 
margin at, and in front of, the beaks is covered with a thin, periostracal 
membrane in fresh material. The yellowish periostracum at the posterior 
end (siphonal end) is thin, but is not leaf-like as in Parapholas. No eggshell- 
like material over the anterior foot gape. This species appears in old books 
as gabbi Tryon. Dead specimens are commonly washed ashore. Siphon 
studded with tiny, rounded flecks of chitinous material.

sembling the False Angel Wing, Petricola pholadijonms, but lacking a 
toothed hinge and ligament, and having a glossy plate rolled over the beaks 



PHOLADIDAE 463 

which is supported by about a dozen, vertical, shelly plates. Not very com- 
mon. 



Genus Xylophaga Turton 1822 
Xylophaga ivashingtona Bartsch Washington Wood-eater 

Washington and Oregon. 

% inch in length, globular and fragile. The large anterior gape has % 
of its area covered by a triangular callum in each upper and outer corner. 
Middle of inside of each valve reinforced by a small, strong, radial cord vi^hich 
is welded to the valve. Color yellowish white. Bores into pieces of water- 
logged wood. Uncommonly collected in dredging hauls. 

The Atlantic species X. dorsalis Turton has much the same characters 
as the above species. It occurs from loo to 300 fathoms from the Arctic 
Seas to off Cape Cod. 

Genus Fenitella Valenciennes 1846 
PeJiitella penita Conrad Flap-tipped Piddock 

Bering Sea to San Diego, California. 

1 % to 3 inches in length, elongate to moderately short, rotund anteriorly, 
becoming compressed and narrow posteriorly where there is a leathery pro- 
longation protecting the siphons. Anterior gape commonly closed by an 
eggshell-like, globose, callus plate which continues up on to the beak region 
in the form of a pair of rather large plates. Just in back of these there is a 
short, triangular plate or protoplax set on top of the middle of the dorsal 
region. Otherwise somewhat resembling the large Farapholas californica. 
Commonly found boring in rocks and shale. The form sagitta "Stearns" 
Dall lacks the calcareous covering over the foot gape. It is found with the 
typical form. 

Genus Fholadidea Turton 18 19 
Pholadidea ovoidea Gould Wart-necked Piddock 

Bering^ Sea to the Gulf of California. 

2 to 3 inches in length, very similar to pilsbryi, but oval in side view. 
About half of the anterior foot gape is covered by eggshell-like, smoothish 
calcareous material. It is not impossible that pilsbryi is an ecological form 
of this species. More studies in their natural history are needed. Moderately

common. John Q. Burch reports that the siphons have characteristic tubercles 
on their surface. Siphon cream, covered with a brownish periostracum at 
the base, the remainder studded with small bars of chitinous material, thus 
giving a warty appearance. 

Genus Nettastoviella Carpenter 1865 
Nettastomella rostrata Valenciennes Rostrate Piddock 

Puget Sound to San Diego, California. 

% inch in length, with a very large, oval gape posteriorly, and anteriorly 
with a long, pointed, smooth rostrum or snout which bends downward. 
Shell proper with widely spaced, delicate, high, concentric lamellae. With- 
out accessory plates and apophyses. Found by breaking stones apart. Mod- 
erately common. 

Genus Parapholas Conrad 1849 
Farapholas californica Conrad Scale-sided Piddock 

Southern California.

terior round in cross-section and gaping. Dorsal margin with 2 long, com- 
plicated, accessory plates. Ventral edge covered by one elongate plate. 
Anterior gape closed over by 2 thin, eggshell-like extensions. Sides of snout 
with foliated periostracum. Shell proper with a long, radial groove pushing 
in at the middle. Color grayish white. Interior with 2 long, descending, 
shelly rods under the middle of the hinge. Common.

Plate 32W 

West Florida to Texas and the West Indies. 



TEREDINIDAE 465 

% to I ^ inches in length, elongate, moderately fragile, gaping at the 
posterior end and whitish in color. There is a faint radial groove from beak to 
ventral margin in each valve. Posterior to this groove, the shell is weakly 
sculptured with concentric growth lines. Anterior to the groove, there 
are crowded, finely denticulated riblets. Dorsal margins of valve joined by 
a long, narrow, fragile plate. Over the umbones there is a broadly rounded, 
somewhat heart-shaped, thick, calcareous plate. Anterior gape closed over 
by an egg-shell callus. Commonly found boring in wood. 

Martesia cuneijormis Say Wedge-shaped Martesia 

North Carolina to Florida, Texas and the West Indies. 

% to % inch in length, similar to striata, but smaller, chubbier, and 
with a somewhat triangular or lanceolate accessory plate which commonly 
has a crease running down the center. There is no free flange extending over 
the beak. Very commonly found burrowing in wood. 

Martesia smithi Tryon Smith's Martesia 

New York to north half of Florida and to Texas. 

% to ^ inch in length. Bores into rocks and old shells. Very chubby, 
with a narrow, pointed posterior end. The shelly plate over the beaks is 
somewhat diamond-shaped, with a pointed anterior end and with no crease 
on the upper surface. Posterior half of the valves with fine, silken, concentric 
threads of periostracum. Fairly common in old oyster shells. 

Family TEREDINIDAE 
Genus Bankia Gray 1842 

This is a genus of shipworms which is very common in warm American 
waters and which is of great economic importance. The two highly spe- 
cialized valves of the clam are very similar to those in Teredo, and cannot 
be used as reliable identification characters. The two plume-like pallets at 
the posterior end of the worm-like animal which can close off the end of the 
burrow are used to distinguish species. In adult specimens, the shell at the 
anterior end which scrapes away the moist wood in the tunnel is about 
/4o the total length of the animal. The mantel secretes a thin, smooth cal- 
careous lining for the burrow as an added protection to the soft body. A 
much fuller and technical account of this group is given by Clench and 
Turner in Johnsonia (1946). The life history is explained in detail by 
Sigerfoos (1908). We have included all three known species in eastern 
American waters, although five others are found in the West Indies.

Pallets and shells are generally preserved in one part glycerin to tour 
parts alcohol (70% grain) to permit later study of the delicate cones in the 
pallets. Permanent slides can be made by soaking the pallets in 90% alcohol 
for 1 2 hours, then placing on a slide, covering with a few drops of diaphane 
or euparol, and adding a long slip-cover.

B. caribbea. Gould's Shipworm is the most widespread and abundant species 
in this genus on the Atlantic Coast, and hence is the most destructive. It 
has been found on the Pacific side of the Panama Canal. It is believed that 
B. inexicana Bartsch is the same species.

Genus Teredo Linne 1758 

Similar to Bcmkia, but the pallet is made up of a single, paddle-shaped 
piece. 

Teredo navalis Linne Common Shipworm 

Both coasts of the United States. Europe and Africa. 

Shell like that in Bankia and subject to many minute variations. Each 
of the 2 calcareous pallets is spathate and compressed, but typically sym- 
metrical. The leathery blade is urn-shaped, widening regularly from a stalk 
of medium length, then tapering somewhat toward the tip, which is decidedly 
excavated. The base of the blade is calcareous, but approximately the distal 
third is normally covered by a yellowish or brownish chitinous epidermis. 
A very common and destructive species found boring in wood. 

Teredo bartscbi Clapp Bartsch's Shipworm 

South Carolina to north half of Florida to Texas. Introduced to San 
Diego, California. 

Shell close to T. navalis, but with the auricle typically semi-circular 
rather than sub-triangular in outline. Pallets: stalk long; blade short and 
deeply excavated at the top. Only the distal half of the blade is invested 
with periostracum, which is light horn-colored and semi-transparent, per- 
mitting the calcareous portion to be seen within as an irregular, hourglass- 
shaped structure with a deep sinus on either side. A common species. 

Teredo diege?isis Bartsch San Diego Shipworm 

Southern half of California. And south? 



468 Afiierican Seashells 

Shell similar to that of T. navalis, but smaller, more finely sculptured and 
transparent, and with numerous, closely set ridges. Pallets: blade with an 
oval, calcareous base, surmounted by a horny cap, amber to black in color. 
The horny portion is commonly deeply excavated at the tip, but may be 
cut off bluntly. The two elements of the blade come apart very easily. 
T. toivnsendi Bartsch is the same according to Kofoid and others.

half as large, not rostrate posteriorly, and with 2 strong radial ribs on the 
posterior dorsal margin of the left valve. 

Pafidora grantilata Dall (Santa Barbara south to La Paz, Mexico) is 
much like bilirata, but half its size, more elongate, and the 2 radial ribs are 
granulated. 



Family THRACIIDAE 
Genus Thracia Blainville 1824 

Shells up to 4 inches in size, thin, chalky in texture, beaks so close that 
the right one becomes punctured by the left beak; ligament external; shell 
commonly moderately rostrate at the posterior end; right valve fatter than 
the left. 



Thracia conradi Couthouy Conrad's Thracia

Nova Scotia to Long Island Sound, New York. 

3 to 4 inches in length, about % as high. Valves obese and chalky-white. 
Hinge without teeth, only thickened considerably behind the beak and be- 
low the large, wide, external ligament. Right beak always punctured by the 
beak in the left valve. Pallial sinus U-shaped but not very deep. Posterior 
end of valves shghtly rostrate and with a weak radial ridge. Rarely washed 
ashore. Not uncommon offshore and down to 150 fathoms. 



Thracia trapezoides Conrad Common Pacific Thracia 

Alaska to Redondo Beach, California. 

2 inches in length and not quite so high; thin, chalky, and with the 
posterior end broadly rostrate. The beak of the right valve has a hole punc- 
tured in it by the beak of the left valve. The posterior rostrated part of the 
valve is set off by a broad, radial, depressed furrow which is bordered by a 
low, rounded, radial ridge. Color drab, grayish white. Commonly dredged 
off the west coast. Compare with T. curta Conrad. 



472 American Seashells 

Thracia curta Conrad Short Western Thracia 

Alaska to Lower California. 

I to 1% inches in length, very similar to trapezoides, but suboval and 
lacking the prominence of rostration. It is very close in shape to our illus- 
tration of the Atlantic T. comadi. A moderately common species. John 
Q. Burch reports that it is relatively abundant at San Onofre, California, 
in the rubbly reef at extreme low tides. It has also been taken from wharf 
pilings, and it is commonly dredged in over 20 fathoms on shale bottoms. 

Genus Cyathodonta Conrad 

Similar to Thracia, but the right beak is without a round hole, and the 
ligament is internal on a definite chondrophore, and the valves are with 
oblique, concentric undulations. This is sometimes considered a subgenus 
of Thracia, not without justification. There is only one species on the 
Pacific Coast of America.

obliquely concentric undulation which are largest at the anterior end, but 
disappear toward the posterior end of the shell. Minute, crowded, granu- 
lated, radial lines are also present. Uncommon. C. diibiosa Dall and C. 
pedroana Dall appear to be this species. 

Family PERIPLOMATIDAE 
Genus Feriploma Schumacher 18 17 

Shell small, oval, right valve fatter than the left, with a slight pearly

A weak radial groove runs from the beak to the anterior part of the ventral 
edge. Moderately common in dredge hauls from i to 200 fathoms. P. papy- 
raceiim is an incorrect spelling for this species. 

Feriploma -fragile Totten, the Fragile Spoon Clam (Labrador to New 
Jersey, 4 to 40 fathoms), differs in being more rostrate anteriorly, the beaks 
pointing more forward and placed more anteriorly. Its chondrophore is 
more horizontal to the hinge line.

each with a short, radial break or slit in the surface. An oblique, low keel 
runs from the beaks to the anterior ventral margin of the valve. The keel 
is bounded posteriorly by a groove. Sculpture consists of microscopic, con- 
centric scratches. Hinge with a single, large, spoon-shaped tooth or chondro- 
phore, above which is a deep slit where the small, free, triangular lithodesma 
fits. This species is especially abundant along certain Texas beaches. P. 
maeqiiivahis Schumacher from the West Indies has not been found in the 
United States, despite several erroneous records.

CHAPTER XI 

Squid, 
Octopus and Cuttlefish 

Class CEPHALOPODA 

Subclass TETRABRANCHIA 

This subclass, which includes the Chambered Nautilus and about 5000 
species of fossil and extinct Ammonites, is not represented in American 
waters. The living species of Nautilus from the Indo-Pacific are character- 
ized by a large, chambered, external shell, by two. pairs of gills, and by their 
numerous suckerless arms. 

Subclass DIBRANCHIA 

All of the living cephalopods with the exception of Nautilus belong to 
this subclass which is characterized by animals that have one pair of gills, 8 
or 10 arms which bear rows of suckers, and whose shell is internal or en- 
tirely absent. 

Order DECAPODA 
(Spirula and Squid) 

With 10 arms, 2 of which are the long tentacular arms; body long and 
cylinder-shaped. An internal shell is present in most cases, and nmv be cal- 
careous (the cuttlebone) or thin and horny (squid pen). The small suckers 
on the arms are usually set on small stalks or peduncles and their apertures 
are armed with horny rings or hooks.

SEPIOLIDAE 479 

The rather fragile, white shell is a chambered cone coiled in a flat spiral, 
usually less than i inch in diameter and with the coils not in contact. Each 
small chamber in the shell is divided from its neighbor by a nacreous-white,

concave, fragile septum or wall. There is a small siphonal tube running back 
into the shell and piercing the septa. These shells are cast up on the beaches 
quite commonly. The body is short and cylindrical, and surrounds the shell 
almost completely except for two small areas. The 8 sessile arms and 2 pe- 
dunculated tentacular arms are very short. 

Myopsid Squid — transparent cornea over eyes; pupils crescent-shaped 

Family SEPIOLIDAE 
Genus Rossia Owen 1828 

Short, "tubby" animals whose bodies are rounded at the end. The man- 
tle edge is free all around. 8 arms short with 2 to 4 rows of spherical suckers 
which have smooth, horny rims. The two tentacular arms can be almost 
entirely withdrawn. The internal pen is slender, lanceolate and very thin and 
delicate. The rather large, semi-circular fins are on the middle of the sides of 
the body. Eye with small eyelid on the lower side, none above. No sulcus 
or notch on front of the eye. 

Rossia pacifica Berry Pacific Bob-tailed Squid 

Alaska to San Diego, California. 

Total length, not including the tentacles, 3 to 4 inches. Body smooth, 
mantle flattened above and below, rounded behind. Fins large, semi-circular 
or subcordate, with a free anterior lobe, their attachment more or less obhque 
to the general plane of the body. Color in life unknown; in alcohol, reduced 
to brownish buff, heavily spotted above and in less degree below with pur- 
plish chromatophore dots, which extend even over the fins, although fewer 
on under surfaces and margins. This is the only Rossia recorded on the 
Pacific Coast, and it is rather abundant from 9 to 300 fathoms.

3 to 4 inches in length, including mantle and longest arm. A small and 
delicate species, very soft, translucent, and delicately rose-colored when liv- 
ing. Internal pen small, very thin and soft. Length of each side fin is about 
% of the body, and the base of attachment of the fin is about % the body- 
length. Arms unequal, the dorsal ones considerably shorter. This species is 
characterized by the larger size of the suckers located along the middle of 
the lateral arms. Commonly dredged from 18 to 233 fathoms. Formerly 
listed as Heteroteuthis tenera Verrill. R. eqiialis Voss, dredged off southeast 
Florida, differs in having the suckers on the lateral arms about equal in size. 

Fa77iily SEPIIDAE 
Genus Sepia Linne 1758 

The common cuttlefish squid of Europe is not represented In our waters, 
although in rare instances the cuttlefish bone or internal shell has been found 
in western Atlantic waters. The cuttlefish bone is an oblong, six-inch or so, 
very light slab of chalky material, rounded at one end, pointed at the other. 
It is used in the manufacture of toothpaste, and is tied to the bars of canary 
cages for the birds to peck at as a source of lime. Ink from Sepia was at one 
time a main source for durable, black writing ink. 

Family LOLIGINIDAE 
Genus Loligo Schneider 1784 

Ten-armed, with elongate, tapering, cylindrical body and large, termi- 
nal, triangular fins. Arms with two rows of suckers provided with horny, 
dentated rings; fourth left arm hectocotylized in the males. Tentacular arms 
with four rows of suckers on their clubs. Internal pen horny, lanceolate with 
its shaft keeled on the under side. The female receives the sperm sacs of the 
male upon a specially developed pad below the mouth. In the genus Lolli- 
guncula, the sperm sacs are received upon a callused patch within the mantle 
near the left gill.

ters. This is L. brevipinna Lesueur and L. hemiptera Howell. 

Genus Sepioteuthis Blainville 1824 

Similar to Loligo, but with large, triangular fins that extend along the 
entire length of the mantle, thus giving the animal an oval outline. Siphonal 
funnel attached to the head by muscular bands. There is a strong wrinkle 
behind the eye. 

Sepioteuthis sepioidea Blainville Atlantic Oval Squid

to % inch). Internal pen thin, lanceolate and without any marginal thick- 
enings. Skin regularly and closely spotted with purple dots. The eggs are 
large, 5 to 8 mm. in diameter, and laid in long jelly tubes. A rather common, 
warm-water species.

by the long, narrow, slightly wavy, dark-colored bands running back along 
the side of the mantle. The rest of the mantle is moderately covered with 
small round dots. The body is long and slender, the triangular fins on the 
last third of the mantle, and the arm suckers do not have pointed teeth on 
the horny circles. A common surface-living species of the Caribbean region.

Total length 40 to ^s ^^^^- Body stout, nearly round, swollen in the 
middle. Arms nearly equal in length, all bearing sharply, serrated suckers. 
Tentacular arms 4 times as long as the 8 sessile arms. The peculiar backward 
pointing tail fins separate this species from A. princeps Verrill, another giant 
squid found in the same area. A large well-preserved specimen of any giant 
squid is worth its weight in gold. No large specimens have been brought 
back from the fishing banks in many years. They may occasionally be 
washed ashore from Nova Scotia north. If you find one, take photographs if 
possible, and notify one of the leading museums. Giant squid of unknown 
identity have been seen in the Gulf of Mexico. 

Family OMMASTREPHIDAE 
Genus lllex Steenstrup 1880 

Resembhng Loligo somewhat, but with half-hidden eyes, the lids free 
and with a distinct notch or sinus in front. Internal pen narrow along the 
middle portion, and with three ribs. There are 8 rows of tiny suckers on 
the end section of the 2 long, tentacular arms. Further study may show that 
the genus lllex is the same as Ominastrephes Orbigny 1835. 

lllex illecebrosus Lesueur Common Short-finned Squid 

Figure 99b 

Greenland to North Carolina and the Gulf of Mexico. 



484 American Se ash ells 

Total length, including tentacular arms, 12 to 18 inches. A common 
squid characterized hj the small opening to the eyes and the small, narrow 
sinus or notch in front of the eyes, and by the proportion of fin-length to 
mantle-length which is roughly i to 3. The sides of the head, back of the 
eyes, have a rather prominent, transverse ridge, back of which the head sud- 
denly narrows to the neck. Under surface of head with a deep, smoothish 
excavation to receive the dorsal half of the siphonal tube. In males, either 
the left or right ventral arm is hectocotylized. A very common species used 
for fish bait. It may be seen in large schools near shore, especially in summer 
in New England. 



Genus Sthenoteuthis Verrill 1880 

Very similar to Illex in almost every way, but the sucker-bearing area 
includes less than one half the total length of the tentacular arms. The larger 
suckers on the tentacular club are strongly toothed, with an additional large 
tooth in each of the four quadrants. 



Sthenoteuthis bartrami Lesueur Flying Squid 

Worldwide. 

2 to 3 feet in total length, resembling the common Illex, but more slen- 
der, with shorter fins, and with 4, not 8, rows of tiny suckers on the end of 
the 2 long tentacular arms. Preserved specimens show a distinct dark, purple- 
brown dorsal stripe. In hfe, the colors are very brilliant and are continually 
changing. Along the middle dorsal line there is a broad violet stripe with a 
stripe of reddish yellow on each side of it. Body elsewhere bluish; fins rosy. 
Skin covered with small, red-violet chromatophore dots. On the eyes there 
are two elongated spots of brilliant blue, and below a bright spot of red. 
Color of ink reported to be a coffee-and-milk color. A common ocean-going 
species which swims with great speed, and not infrequently jumps out of 
water and lands on the decks of ships. Like most squid, it is attracted by 
artificial light. 

Order OCTOPODA 

The octopods have only 8 arms and are without the 2 long tentacular 
arms that are characteristic of the squid. The suckers on the arms are with- 
out stalks and are not equipped with horny rings. No internal pen or shell. 
This order includes the many forms of Octopus and the Paper Nautilus, 
Argonauta. The female Argonauta secretes a shell to hold her eggs. 



OCTOPODIDAE 485 

Family ARGON AUTIDAE 
Genus Argonaut a Linne 1758 

Pelagic octopods in which the dorsal arms of the female are broadly- 
expanded into glandular membranes that secrete and hold a delicate, cal- 
careous shell for containing the eggs. The males are considerably smaller 
than the females, do not have a shell, and the third right arm is modified into 
a detachable copulatory organ which persists separately for a certain length 
of time in the mantle cavity of the female.

Family TREMOCTOPODIDAE 
Genus Tremoctopus Delle Chiaje 1829 

Tremoctopus violaceus Delle Chiaje Common Umbrella Octopus 

Pelagic in warm waters. Worldwide. 

Total length, including the arms, 3 to 6 feet. Deep purplish red in color. 
Characterized by the long skin webs between the four dorsal arms, and the 
two large holes in the body near the base of the third arm and in front of 
the eyes. The species is gregarious, and is occasionally washed ashore on the 
east coast of Florida. 

Family OCTOPODIDAE 

Genus Octopus Lamarck 1798 

There are only five valid species of littoral Octopus so far recorded 
along the Atlantic Coast. There are a few deep water ones, some of which 



486 Ajnerican Seashelh 

belong to closely related genera. The characters most relied upon in dis- 
tinguishing species are relative length of the arms, the skin surface, the nature 
and relative length of the small ligula (the tiny pad-like extension on the 
end of the third right arm in the males, i.e., the hectocotylized arm). The 
number of gill plates and color pattern are used to a less extent. 

The eight arms have each been given a number, in order that com- 
parisons may be made. This is done by setting the octopus down with the 
body up, and the arms spread-eagle out in all directions. Turn the octopus 
so that the two eyes are on the side away from you. By going from the eyes 
out to the mantle edge away from you, and choosing the first arm to the 
right, you have located the first arm. Further clockwise are the second, third 
and fourth right arms. Instead of counting further (fifth arm, etc.), return 
to the center again, and count to the left — hence, the first, second, third and 
fourth left arms. When giving an arm formula, only the right ones are gen- 
erally given, and they are set down in order of large to smaller size. Hence, 
4.3.1.2 means the fourth arm is the largest, the second one the smallest in 
length. It may be pointed out, that on rare occasions an octopus may acci- 
dentally lose an arm. 

There are two simple sets of measurements (all in millimeters) which 
are important in distinguishing the species of Octopus. The first is the 
mantle-arm index which simply means the comparison of the length of the 
mantle (measure from the round, bulbous "head" end to a point just between 
the eyes) with the length of the longest arm (turn the octopus over, measure 
from the mouth to the tip of the longest stretched-out arm). An index is 
obtained by multiplying the mantle-length by 100 and then dividing the 
result by the arm-length. 

The ligula index is obtained only from males and from the third right 
arm which is a modified sex organ. The ligula is measured from tip to the 
last sucker. The arm length is obtained as explained in the preceding para- 
graph. The index is: length of ligula, multiplied by 100, the result divided 
by the total arm-length. The number of gill plates and the size of eggs are 
determined by cutting a deep slit in the body.

Connecticut to Florida and the West Indies. Europe. 

Length, including the longest arm, i to 3 feet (the latter would give a 
radial spread of about 7 feet). Mantle-arm index in Florida and North 
Carolina is about 25 (that is, the arms are 4 times as long as the mantle). 
Ligula-index below 2.5. Cill plates 7 to 9 (in Bermuda, usually 10 or 11). 
In life, skin smoothish; preserved, it is rugose with variously shaped warts. 
Eggs 3 mm. or less in length. A common harmless species found hidden away 



OCTOPODIDAE 487 

under large rocks and crevices near shore. This is O. rugosus of authors, 
O. americaniis Blainville and O. carolinensis Verrill. 

Octopus macropus Risso of the West Indies (and possibly Key West) 
has its first arm the largest and longest, has a hgula-index up to 14, and a 
wart over one side of the eye. The skin in preserved material has small 
reddish warts. The eggs are less than 2 mm. in length (see fig. looe).

Briar Octopus 

Fissure looc 



Octopus briareus Robson 

Southern Florida and the West Indies. 

Length, including longest arm, i to i Y2 feet. Arms fairly thick at the 
bases, quite long, especially the third and sometimes the second. Mantle- 
index 13 to 30, but usually about 17. Ligula-index about 4. Gill plates 7, 
rarely 8. Skin smoothish, or finely granular in preserved material; in life, 
pinkish brown to red-mottled. Eggs elongate, translucent-white, 10 to 12 
mm. in length and with equally long attachment stalks. Fairly common be- 
tween tides under large coral blocks on the Lower Florida Keys. 



Octopus burryi Voss 

Southern half of Florida and the Gulf of Mexico. 



Hurry's Octopus 

Figure loob 



Length, including the longest arm, 6 to 10 inches. Characterized by a 
broad band of dark purple on the top surface of the arms, and, in preserved 
specimens, by the skin which is covered with closely set, round papillae or 
warts. Gill plates 8 to 10 in number. Ligula-index 4 to 5. This is a recently 
described species named after a famous Florida collector, Leo L. Burry of 



488 Avierican Seashells 

Pompano Beach, Florida. It is a moderately common, fairly shallow-water 
species. 

Octopus joubini Robson Joubin's Octopus 

Figure lood 

Southern half of Florida, and the West Indies. 

A small species with a length, including the longest arm, of from 4 to 
6, rarely 7 inches. The arms are short, with a mantle-arm index of about 40 
to 50. Ligula-index about 6 to 7. Gill plates 5 or 6 usually. Skin smoothish, 
except for little pimples at scattered intervals. In this species, the longest arm 
is only 2 or 3 times the mantle-length, while in O. briareus the longest arm 
is 5 or 6 times as long as the mantle. Eggs large, amber-colored, and about 
7 to 10 mm. in length. Occasionally cast ashore in fair numbers on the west 
coast of Florida. O. 77ter cat oris Adam 1937 is the same. Formerly placed in 
the genus Paroctopus which is now considered of no value. 

Octopus hongkongensis Hoyle Common Pacific Octopus 

Figure loof 

Alaska to Lower California. Japan to south China. 

Length, including longest arm, ^ to 3 feet (possibly with a radial spread 
of nearly 28 feet in Alaskan waters). Skin in preserved specimens covered 
everywhere by numerous small, pimple-like tubercles with star-shaped bases, 
and by many heavy, much interrupted, longitudinal wrinkles. Above each 
eye there is a rather small, conical wart and with a very large, pinnacle-like 
protuberance behind it. Ligula index 4 to 7. The web between the second 
and third arms usually extends out to a quarter of the arm's length. Else- 
where the webs are shorter. The commonest littoral Octopus on the Pacific 
Coast found from shore to 100 fathoms. This is O. punctatns Gabb. 

O. calif ornicus Berry, an off-shore species, has a large lingula with an 
index of 14 to 17. The skin in preserved material is covered with numerous, 
large stellate warts. The Californian Deep-water Octopus. 

Octopus bi?naculatus Verrill Two-spotted Octopus 

Los Angeles, California, to Lower California. 

Total length ^ to 2 feet. Characterized by a large, distinct, round, dark 
spot in front of each eye near the base of each third arm. Eggs small, 1.8 to 
4.0 mm. in length with long stalks, attached in festoons. Mantle-arm index 
usually 22, but ranging from 14 to 29. Ligula-index 2.0, not significant in 
separating this species from bimaculoides. Fairly common. Lives in the lower 
part of the intertidal zone down to several feet where there is rock bottom. 



OCTOPODIDAE 489 

Aside from egg-size and egg-clusters and mantle-arm index, there is great 
difficulty in separating this species from O. bimaciiloides Pickford which 
lives nearby in shallower water where there is mud present. 

Octopus bimaciiloides Pickford Mud-flat Octopus 

Los i\ngeles, California, to Lower California. 

Almost identical with O. bimacidatus Verrill. Eggs large, 9.5 to 17.5 
mm. in length, with shorter stalks, attached in small clusters. Mantle-arm 
index 34, but ranging from 29 to 39. Fairly common in shallow water among 
rocks where mud is present. Adults are somewhat smaller than bimacidatus.

CHAPTER XII 

Guide to the 
Molluscan Literature 



The literature dealing with mollusks is very extensive and widely scattered 
in many journals and books. Since 1900, approximately 60,000 separate 
articles on mollusks have appeared. Most of these are listed according to 
author and subject matter in the Zoological Record (printed for the Zoologi- 
cal Society of London and in its 86th volume). This valuable journal may 
be found in any large museum or university library. The bibliography in- 
cluded here is intended only as a guide or lead to the more important books 
and articles dealing primarily with American marine mollusks.
